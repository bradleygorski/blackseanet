		<li><b>Valetina Izmirlieva</b> | Principal Investigator | <a href="mailto:vbi1@columbia.edu">vbi1@columbia.edu</a></li>
		<p></p>
		<p>Valentina Izmirlieva is a historian of Balkan and Russian religious cultures. 
		She holds an appointment as Professor in the Slavic Department of Columbia University, 
		where she has taught since 1999 and currently serves as Department Chair. 
		She is also the Faculty Director of the Columbia Summer Program in Balkan 
		Transcultural Studies, hosted by Boğaziçi University in Istanbul and developed in 
		partnership with the Columbia Global Centers—Turkey.</p>
		<p>Much of Professor Izmirlieva’s work addresses cultural exchanges among Christians, 
		Jews, and Muslims in the context of multi-ethnic, multi-religious empires and their 
		successor states. She explores religious coexistence through a wide range of quotidian 
		forms, inviting a conversation about Muslim-Christian-Jewish interactions outside the 
		dominant paradigms of “conflict studies” and “the clash of civilizations.” She is the 
		author of <i>All the Names of The Lord: Lists, Mysticism and Magic</i> (University of Chicago, 
		2008), co-editor (with Boris Gasparov) of the volume <i>Translation and Tradition in Slavia 
		Orthodoxa</i> (2012), and contributor to the recent <i>Routledge Companion to Literature and 
		Religion</i> (2016) with a chapter on Dostoevsky.  Her current project is a monograph 
		about Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem who took as their model the Muslim Hajj to Mecca.</p> 
		<p>Professor Izmirlieva is the recipient of major academic distinctions, including 
		Fulbright Scholarship, Fellowship at the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion 
		in the University of Chicago’s Divinity School, Title VIII National Research Competition 
		Grant by the National Council for East European and Eurasian Research, and Howard 
		Foundation Fellowship. In 2012-2013, she was the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellow 
		at the Center for Scholars and Writers of the New York Public Library.</p>

		<li><b>Rossen Djagalov</b> | Assistant Professor of Slavic Literature (New York University)</li>
		<p></p>
		<p>Rossen Djagalov is an Assistant Professor of Russian at NYU. His interests lie 
		in socialist culture globally and, more specifically, in the linkages between cultural 
		producers and audiences in the USSR and abroad. His manuscript, “Premature Postcolonialists: 
		Soviet-Third-World Literary and Cinematic Encounters in the Age of Three Worlds,” 
		reconstructs the history of the main organizations within which those encounters took 
		place–the Afro-Asian Writers’ Association (founded in Tashkent in 1958) and the 
		biannual Tashkent Festival of African, Asian and Latin American Film (1968-1990)–and 
		their consequences for Soviet and Third-World literature and film. His second book 
		project, “The People’s Republic of Letters: Towards a Media History of Twentieth-Century 
		Socialist Internationalism,” examines the relationship between the political left and 
		the different media that at different times played a major role in connecting its publics 
		globally (the proletarian novel of the first half of the 20th century, the singer-songwriter 
		performance of the 1960s, and contemporary documentary film). He is a member of the LeftEast 
		editorial collective. Prior to coming to NYU, Rossen was a graduate student at Yale’s 
		Comparative Literature program, a lecturer at Harvard’s History and Literature Program, 
		a Penn Humanities Forum postdoctoral fellow, and an Assistant Professor in Comparative 
		Literature at Koç University, Istanbul.</p>
