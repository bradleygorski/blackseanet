                <p align='justify'>Valentina Izmirlieva is a historian of Balkan and Russian religious cultures. 
		            She holds an appointment as Professor in the Slavic Department of Columbia University, 
		            where she has taught since 1999 and currently serves as Department Chair. 
		            She is also the Faculty Director of the Columbia Summer Program in Balkan 
		            Transcultural Studies, hosted by Boğaziçi University in Istanbul and developed in 
		            partnership with the Columbia Global Centers—Turkey.</p>
		        <p align='justify'>Much of Professor Izmirlieva’s work addresses cultural exchanges among Christians, 
		            Jews, and Muslims in the context of multi-ethnic, multi-religious empires and their 
		            successor states. She explores religious coexistence through a wide range of quotidian 
		            forms, inviting a conversation about Muslim-Christian-Jewish interactions outside the 
		            dominant paradigms of “conflict studies” and “the clash of civilizations.” She is the 
		            author of <i>All the Names of The Lord: Lists, Mysticism and Magic</i> (University of Chicago, 
		            2008), co-editor (with Boris Gasparov) of the volume <i>Translation and Tradition in Slavia 
		            Orthodoxa</i> (2012), and contributor to the recent <i>Routledge Companion to Literature and 
		            Religion</i> (2016) with a chapter on Dostoevsky.  Her current project is a monograph 
		            about Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem who took as their model the Muslim Hajj to Mecca.</p> 
		        <p align='justify'>Professor Izmirlieva is the recipient of major academic distinctions, including 
		            Fulbright Scholarship, Fellowship at the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion 
		            in the University of Chicago’s Divinity School, Title VIII National Research Competition 
		            Grant by the National Council for East European and Eurasian Research, and Howard 
		            Foundation Fellowship. In 2012-2013, she was the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellow 
		            at the Center for Scholars and Writers of the New York Public Library.</p>

		        <p align='justify'>Rossen Djagalov is an Assistant Professor of Russian at NYU. His interests lie 
		            in socialist culture globally and, more specifically, in the linkages between cultural

		            Soviet-Third-World Literary and Cinematic Encounters in the Age of Three Worlds,” 
		            reconstructs the history of the main organizations within which those encounters took 
		            place–the Afro-Asian Writers’ Association (founded in Tashkent in 1958) and the 
		            biannual Tashkent Festival of African, Asian and Latin American Film (1968-1990)–and 
		            their consequences for Soviet and Third-World literature and film. His second book 
		            project, “The People’s Republic of Letters: Towards a Media History of Twentieth-Century 
		            Socialist Internationalism,” examines the relationship between the political left and 
		            the different media that at different times played a major role in connecting its publics 
		            globally (the proletarian novel of the first half of the 20th century, the singer-songwriter 
		            performance of the 1960s, and contemporary documentary film). He is a member of the LeftEast 
		            editorial collective. Prior to coming to NYU, Rossen was a graduate student at Yale’s
