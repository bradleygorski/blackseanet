<h4>The end of the region?<br>
The future of spatial constructs in the populist era</h4>
<p align="justify"><b><i>An interdisciplinary conference at the University of Liège, 29 Nov 2017</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">Trump, BREXIT, Russian-European crisis and the rise of populist parties in 
Europe and Turkey came as an existential challenge to regionalism in Europe, Eurasia and worldwide. 
The conference - organised by Centre for International Relations Studies of the University of Liège 
and Cambridge Ukrainian Studies and Columbia University (U.S.), and co-funded by the European Union - 
seeks to address broad sets of questions about the e ects of the above phenomena on the regions, 
broadly conceived.</p>
<p align="justify">In particular, the organisers invite papers which would look into the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li> To what extent the rise of ‘economic nationalism’ in the UK and the US puts an end on 
regionalisation processes in Europe, North-America, Trans-Atlantic trade and overall state of 
regional integration in di erent parts of the world.</li>
<li> How the changes in the core of world economic system will a ect regional integration and 
regional identities in other emerging regions in the world, i.e. Eastern Partnership, Central Asia, etc.</li>
<li> Will a new regionalism be limited to ‘shallow’ free trade zones or new forms of protectionist 
regional blocs will emerge as compromise between globalism and localism?</li>
<li> Will these new forms stick to neo-liberalism or will they adhere to other ideologies, thus, 
creating new spatial entities on totally di erent principles? How will such regions imagine themselves, 
other regions and structures of global governance?</li>
<li> Will the region exist as an objective entity or will it degrade into fractured amalgam of 
communities prone to multidimensional disintegration under new tensions brining down regional orders 
and leading to inter-state con icts?</li>
<li> Where did it come from? The session will explore the ideational sources of the new forms of 
nationalism and populism. We would welcome papers looking into popular culture in order to explore 
how great and regional powers imagine themselves and surrounding neighbourhoods and how this imagination 
informs region-building processes.</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">Papers which consider the above and related questions through the prism of regional 
conditions in Eastern Europe, Black Sea region and Central Asia are particularly welcome.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>The conference will be held at the University of Liège on 29 November 2017</b>
<br> > Limited funding is available for travel and accommodation of paper-givers.
<br> > 500-word abstracts with the title, research questions and methodology should be submitted <a href="goo.gl/0xDZRp">here</a>. 
<br> > Deadline for submissions is 25 August 2017.</p>

European Journal of Eurasian Dialogues, which sets to launch dialogue between European intellectuals 
and policy makers and other regions. Selection results will be circulated by the end of August 2017.</b></p>

<h4>Perspectives on Crimea, special issue of <a href='http://www.shimajournal.org'>Shima</a></h4>

<p align="justify">As a large, peninsular ‘almost island’, Crimea dominates the northern area of the 
Black Sea and the entrance to the smaller Sea of Azov to its north. Historically Crimea has had a distinct 
history and a distinct sense of identity with regard to the Ukraine and Russia that has been reflected in 
the shifting political administration of the region. Within Crimea, the port city of Sevastopol has also 
had its own status and trajectory. This special issue of Shima will address various aspects of the socio-cultural 
and political history and present of Crimea and the northern Black Sea region. Proposals are invited for 
papers on aspects such as:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Senses of Crimean identity</li>
<li>Cultural minorities in Crimea</li>
<li>Linguistic and literary aspects of Crimea</li>
<li>Crimean diasporic cultures</li>
<li>Crimean-Ukrainian and Crimean-Russian relations</li>
<li>Representations of Crimea in various media (such as Vasily Aksyonov’s novel Island of Crimea or Konstantin Klyatskin’s film Crimea: As it was)</li>
<li>Theorisations of Crimea, its spatiality and historical forms</li>
<li>Visual essays on aspects of Crimea</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The special issue will be guest edited by <b>Olga Oleinikova</b> (University of Technology Sydney).</p>

<p align="justify">Articles should be between 4000 and 8000 words in length and should be submitted in Shima house style. (See <a href='http://shimajournal.org/instructions.php'>style guidelines here</a>.)</p>

<p align="justify">Proposals are invited at any time (please send to <a href='mailto:prhshima@gmail.com'>prhshima@gmail.com</a>). Final copy deadline is May 20, 2018.</p>
