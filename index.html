								<h2>About the Black Sea Networks Initiative<br />
								</h2>
								<div align="justify">
								<p>The Black Sea has linked the cultures and economies of Europe, 
		Central Asia, and the Middle East for millennia. Today, the Black Sea region is the 
		site of political and ecologic crises with global repercussions. But the region’s 
		countries, with their diverse languages, religions, cultures, and political systems, 
		are too often viewed in isolation, without a clear understanding of their profound 
		interconnections. To successfully meet global challenges, we must learn to work with 
		religious, cultural, and linguistic diversity, and understand the complex local contexts 
		in which ordinary people lead their lives.</p>
		<p><strong>Black Sea Networks</strong> is an international teaching and learning initiative 
		at Columbia University that connects regions, disciplines, and institutions, creating 
		educational and research programs that target the diversity of cultural practices in a 
		highly strategic zone. Building upon existing initiatives, including the Columbia-Boğaziçi 
		Summer Program in Balkan Transcultural Studies, which was developed in partnership with 
		Global Centers | Turkey, Black Sea Networks reconceptualizes existing programs within a 
		larger Black Sea framework. Based in Columbia’s Slavic Department, the initiative will 
		foster new bonds among Slavic Studies, Hellenic Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, and 
		East Asian Studies, creating opportunities to establish innovative interdisciplinary 
		programs of study, such as Black Sea Studies and Environmental Science, or Black Sea 
		Studies and Economics.</p>
