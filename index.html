								<h2>About the Black Sea Networks Initiative<br />
								</h2>
								<div align="justify">
								<p>The Black Sea has linked the cultures and economies of Europe, 
								Central Asia, and the Middle East for millennia. Today, the Black Sea 
								region is the site of political and ecologic crises with global 
								repercussions. But the regionâ€™s diverse countries and cultures 
								are too often viewed in isolation.</p>
								<p>Black Sea Networks is an international teaching and learning 
								initiative at Columbia University that will connect regions, 
								disciplines, and institutions, creating educational and research 
								programs that target the diversity of cultural practices in a highly strategic zone. 
								  </p><p>Traditional land-based area studies focus on divisions, 
								  on fixed and heavily contested borders. In contrast, water-based 
								  studies emphasize connectivity, mobility, and exchange. 
								  The Black Sea Networks initiative envisions an open sea 
								  connected to waterways and land routes that lead east, 
								  to China; south, to the Mediterranean and the Red Sea; 
								  west, to the heart of Central Europe; and north, to the Baltic Sea and beyond.</p>
								  <p>Black Sea Networks aims to reorient the field of Slavic Studies, 
								  from a shared identity&mdash;imagined as homogenous&mdash;toward a shared space 
								  of ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural heterogeneity, with 
								  communities and individuals bound by durable links of cooperation, 
								  competition, and cohabitation. This new framework will help foster 
								  a generation of Slavists with a vision of the field that speaks to 
								  the concerns of our global age.</p>
