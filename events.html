<li><h4>The Legacy of Ovid in the Black Sea Region</h4>
with Professor <b>Adina Ciugureanu</b>, Ovidius University, Constanta, Romania, 
<br>and Fulbright Visiting Scholar, Columbia University
<p>April 12, 2017 | 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM | 1219 International Affairs Building | Columbia University</p>

<div class="w3-row w3-center w3-padding-small"><img src="images/Ciugureanu.jpg" style="width:30%" alt="">
			</div>

<p align="justify">Publius Ovidius Naso, whose passing 2000 years ago is commemorated this year, 
has had a tremendous influence on literature, philosophy, and the arts throughout the two millennia 
since his death on the Black Sea shore. The conference will open with a short presentation of Ovid’s 
life, writings and allegations that caused his exile to the “bleak” Greek city, Tomis, in yr 9 A.D., 
and will continue with the poet’s legacy in Europe in general and in the Balkan area in particular. 
The talk will focus on exile and its effects, as a major theme that have inspired writers throughout 
centuries as well as on the reception of Ovid in the Balkan countries’ cultures through partial 
translations of his writings.</p>   

<p align="justify"><b>Dr. Adina Ciugureanu</b> is Professor of British and American culture at Ovidius University, 
Constanta, Romania and the Chair of the Institute of Doctoral Studies. Her research interest covers the Victorian 
and modernist ages in both Britain and the USA, with special focus on consumerism and, more recently, on 
geocriticism and urban studies. She has published five books and over 40 articles and volume chapters in 
reputed national and international academic journals and conference volumes. Following her first Fulbright 
grant (2001-2002) she authored a volume and individual articles on American popular culture. She has 
also edited and co-edited 8 conference volumes. Currently, she benefits from the second Fulbright grant 
at UCSB, doing research on cityscape, especially LA, and its representations in American fiction. Apart 
from Columbia, she will lecture at the Global Awareness Center at the Arkansas State University-Beebe.</p>

<li><h4>Across the Black Sea: Russian-Ottoman Encounters in the 18th and 19th Centuries<span class="people-bio-button" title="Toggle Bio">▼</span>
</h4>
<p>Convened by <b>Catherine Evtuhov</b>
<br>April 22, 2017 | International Affairs Building 1219 | Columbia University</p>
 <div class="people-bio">
 <p align="justify">“Across the Black Sea” takes stock of the field of Black Sea history 
 as it has taken shape over the past twenty years by convening not a discussion about Black Sea studies 
 in general, but an assessment of what specifically historical inquiry has accomplished. Our focus is the imperial 
 period – the 18th and 19th centuries – when encounters between the Russian and Ottoman empires were at 
 their most intense, and have in the past been conceived as exclusively conflictual and thus as a narrative of wars 
 and conquests.</p>
 
  <p align="justify">Relations between the Russian and Ottoman Empires in many ways defined European politics in the 
  18th and 19th centuries. Long known as part of the “Eastern Question,” the struggle for control of the 
  Black Sea region involved a much more profound interaction than only military confrontation. New scholarship has 
  focused increasingly on migration and disease, diplomatic representation and missions, instances of military cooperation, 
  intellectual and cultural exchange, imperial integration of local elites, viticulture on the Crimean peninsula, and other 
  topics that acknowledge the Russian and Ottoman Empires as actors in determining the fate of the Black Sea and the Straits, 
  rather than as either relentless aggressors or passive pawns of the European powers. A signal feature of recent research is 
  its ability to incorporate Russian and Ottoman languages, and bring together materials from both Russian and Turkish archives.</p>

  <p align="justify">The emphasis of the workshop is on new scholarship, which means that junior faculty and especially 
  recent PhDs and advanced graduate students play a major role, along with established authors of path-breaking 
  recent studies. A second hallmark is attention to digital scholarship, which has been particularly successful and 
  promising with respect to Black Sea history. While the focus of the current workshop is the important 18th and 
  19th centuries, there are also important studies underway on the 20th and the “Socialist Black Sea,” which 
  we include in our purview. The community from Slavic languages and literatures, sociology, economics, and political 
  science are encouraged to attend and enrich the discussion.</p>

   <li><h4>BLACK SEA HISTORY, 19TH CENTURY: RESEARCH AND WRITING<span class="people-bio-button" title="Toggle Bio">▼</span>
       <br>A Black Sea Networks Seminar</h4>
       <p>Convened by <b>Valentina Izmirlieva</b>
       <br>with <b>Gelina Harlaftis</b>, Professor of Maritime History, Ionian University, Greece
       <br>Friday, March 24, 2017 | 4:00pm-6:00pm | Columbia University | 707 International Affairs Building</p>
       
        <div class="people-bio">
       
       <div class="w3-row w3-center w3-padding-small"><img src="images/IonianShips.jpg" style="width:70%" alt="">
			</div>
       
       <p align='justify'>How does one write the history of a Sea? The Black Sea regions share political economy, 
       trade, shipping, finance, industry, and cultures, linked together by land and sea routes. During the nineteenth 
       century, the area became the world's largest grain and oil producer. From the last third of the 18th century 
       to the beginning of the 20th century, more than 24 port cities sprang up on the coastline. These port cities 
       became centers of attraction for economic immigration from the whole region of central and south-eastern 
       Europe, while more established mobile, entrepreneurial groups like Greeks, Jews, and Armenians took charge 
       of external trade and shipping.</p>

	   <p align='justify'>Maritime history is unusual in placing the sea, its ports and its entrepreneurs at 
	   the centre of analysis, looking beyond national borders. Based on two research projects that ran from 
	   2007 to 2015 from Ionian University in Corfu, I will present the maritime history methodology that we 
	   used to research and write the Black Sea history. Some of the results will be presented, drawing on Eastern 
	   and Western European archives and academic networks with 20 universities and research centers from Greece, 
	   Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Turkey.</p>
       
       <p align='justify'><b>Gelina Harlaftis</b> is Professor of Maritime History in the Department of History of 
       Ionian University. She graduated from the University of Athens and completed her graduate studies at the 
       Universities of Cambridge (M.Phil.) and Oxford (D.Phil.). She was President of the International Maritime 
       Economic History Association (2004–2008) and visiting Fellow in universities of Canada, the United States 
       and the United Kingdom. She has led numerous research projects, the most recent being “The Black Sea and 
       its port cities, 1774-1914. Development, convergence and linkages with the global economy” within the 
       operational programme “Thalis,” co-financed by the European Union and the Greek Ministry of Education 
       from 2012–2015 (<a href="http://www.blacksea.gr">www.blacksea.gr</a>). Her most recent books are <i>Merchant ‘Colonies’ in the Early Modern 
       Period (15th–18th Centuries)</i> with Viktor Zakharov and Olga Katsiardi-Hering (Chatto & Pickering 2012), 
       <i>World’s Key Industry</i> with Jesus Valdaliso and Stig Tenold (Palgrave/Macmillan 2012), <i>Greek Shipping 
       History, 1700–1821</i> with Katerina Papakonstantinou (Kedros, Athens, 2013, in Greek) and <i>Greeks in the 
       Azov, from the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century. New approaches in the history of the Greeks in 
       South Russia</i> with Evrydiki Sifneos (National Research Foundation, Athens 2015).</p>

       <p align='justify'>Join NYRB Poets for a celebration of the first US publication of Austerity Measures: 
       The New Greek Poetry, edited by Karen Van Dyck (The Scattered Papers of Penelope). Austerity Measures 
       collects the best, most provocative poetry written in the wake of the 2008 debt crisis that shook Greece 
       and the rest of the world. More recently, Greece has become one of the main channels into Europe for refugees 
       from poverty and war, an attendant reality that influences much of the poetry in this collection as well. At 
       this event, Van Dyck will be joined by Maria Margaronis of The Nation, Kurdish-Greek writer Hiva Panahi 
       (Secrets of the Snow), Greek-Albanian writer Gazmend Kapllani (A Short Border Handbook), and the poet Yusef 
       Komunyakaa (The Emperor of Water Clocks) for an evening of discussion and readings that will touch on the 
       intersection between poetry, translation, journalism, and the refugee experience.</p>
       
       <p align='justify'>A portion of book sale proceeds from the evening will be donated to the ACLU and books 
       by the participants, as well as Austerity Measures, will be available.</p>

             tell the whole story. In order to bring the pieces of the puzzle together we move between different scenes, from today’s 
             welfare Sweden all the way to Suzanne Khardalian’s childhood in Beirut. Produced by PeÅ Holmquist.</p>

       <p align="justify"><b>Romantic Prosaics and Modern Armenian Culture: 
       <br>How to Read Khachatur Abovyan’s Wounds of Armenia, and Why</b>
       <br>Although no sovereign Armenian state existed from the fourteenth century until the twentieth, “Armenia” figured 
       quite prominently in Russian imperial public discourse, giving rise to a rhetorical formation that foregrounded the 
       ordinary and the domestic. The Russo-Persian War of 1826-28 prompted a multi-lingual, multi-generic response that included 
       historical and ethnographic writing, poetry and prose, and reportage. I propose to re-read Khachatur Abovyan’s chronicle of 
       the Russo-Persian war, <i>Wounds of Armenia </i> (finished circa 1841), the first major novel in the Eastern Armenian vernacular, 
       in an artistic, cultural and historical context, with attention to its reception in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and 
       beyond. A not-quite-historical-novel produced by a self-styled and self-consciously stateless Eurasian cultural tradition 
       that came to Romanticism rather late, <i>Wounds of Armenia</i> invites its reader to interrogate many of the familiar 
       categories of Romantic nationalism and literary modernity while looking both east- and westward from the Ararat valley of 
       the Armenian revivalist imagination.</p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Bella Grigoryan</b> is Associate Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale. 
       Her specific areas of research include the rise of the reading public and the periodical press, theory and 
       history of the novel, the history and politics of social estates in Imperial Russia, and modern Armenian literature 
       and culture from the late eighteenth century to the contemporary moment. Her first book, <i>Noble Subjects: The 
       Russian Novel and the Gentry, 1762-1861</i>, will be published by Northern Illinois University Press in 2017. </p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Migration, Translingualism, Translation</b>
       <br>Increasingly, literature asks how to translate the foreign accents and translingual idioms of the migrant. 
       Two contemporary Greek novellas create transliterative and homophonic spaces that are themselves translational. 
       Thanasis Valtinos’s <i>The Book of Andreas Kordopatis, Part One, America</i> (1964), represents early migration 
       with a story of a Greek making his way from his hometown in the Peloponnese to New Orleans, while Sotiris Dimitriou’s 
       <i>May Your Name be Blessed</i> (1993), addresses the more recent migration of a boy, born in Albania to Greek parents, 
       who returns to Greece when the communist regime ends. Both texts create shared linguistic spaces that resonate for two 
       or more communities, helping readers to rethink concepts of cultural belonging. Existing English translations of these 
       macaronic texts are contrasted with translations that introduce translingual sound patterning and intertextual references. 
       Comparative studies of translingualism in literature and translations can offer new categories for understanding migration 
       and enable fresh interventions into the debates on world literature, while also stimulating the development of inventive 
       translation practices. </p>

	<p align='justify'>Our research-a-thon will compile a database that shows when the words for fruits 
	and vegetables entered the various Black Sea languages. This data set will allow us to map the spread 
	of these linguistic units against known Black Sea trade routes, to see whether, as one might expect, 
	fruit names were borrowed as the fruits themselves were bought and sold. If this hypothesis proves 
	inadequate, the non-coincidence of trade routes and linguistic spread could give rise to speculation 
	about alternative or previously unknown trade routes, about the (intentional) skewing of linguistic 
	data to conform to narratives of nationhood, or other possibilities.</p>

    <p align='justify'>The resulting data set will be made available to other scholars to employ in their 
    own research, expand to adjacent regions, or re-imagine in other ways. Our visualizations will be 
    presented on the Black Sea Networks website and contribute to a publication in the forthcoming issue of

            While the Christian “Hajj” to Jerusalem emerged as an Ottoman phenomenon already in the 17th century, 
			     in the early 19th century it underwent a significant transformation. The hajjis began to 
			     travel “family style,” taking along not only their wives and male children, but also 
			     their elderly mothers and unmarried daughters of all age. Despite the dangers of the 
			     long trip, some took their new brides on a honeymoon pilgrimage so that their first 
			     child would be conceived in Jerusalem, and some even took their pregnant wives so that 
			     they would give birth in the Holy Land. The Orthodox Hajj to Jerusalem thus emerged as a 
			     family project and a surprising vehicle for female mobility, creativity, and empowerment. 
			     This talk will explore how this transformation occurred and why.</p>

           By the beginning of the 20th century, two-thirds of all pilgrims from the Russian Empire to the Holy Land were female. Their lived experience of pilgrimage involved 
            visits to the shrines and the associated devotional practices, but also everyday problems 
            and the unavoidable navigation around international diplomatic issues, local politics 
            and Greek-Russian relations of the time. In facing some or all of these challenges, 
            women pilgrims proved to be active agents, willing to antagonize constituted authority 
            in order to preserve a modicum of independent action. As such, they energetically pursued 
            their own version of the pilgrimage experience, above and beyond that envisioned by 
            Russian authorities in the Holy Land.</p>

 <li><h4>THE IMITATION IMPERATIVE: <br>MAKING SENSE OF THE CRISIS OF BLACK SEA EUROPE<span class="people-bio-button" title="Toggle Bio">▼</span>
 </h4>
 
 <p>A Public Lecture by <b>Ivan Krastev</b> Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, permanent fellow at the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna
 <br>Convened by <b>Valentina Izmirlieva</b>
       <br>September 23, 2016 | Columbia University</p>

                <p></p>
                <p><i>text by Sophie Pinkham</i><br>
                <p align='justify'>On September 23rd, Ivan Krastev kicked off the Black Sea Networks initiative with a lecture entitled “The Imitation Imperative: Making Sense of the Crisis of Black Sea Europe.” Krastev, an expert on Eastern European democracy, called for a re-examination of the post-1989 world order, arguing that the model of universal imitation of Western liberal democracy has become a source of renewed nationalist and anti-globalist sentiment. Today, he argued, the most urgent question is not how the West is transforming the rest of the world, but how the West itself is being transformed. These questions are especially pertinent in the Black Sea region, at the intersection of the three empires—Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian—that constituted the European order until the end of the First World War.</p>
                <p align='justify'>According to Francis Fukuyama’s influential concept of the “end of history,” there were simply no alternatives to liberal democracy; the post-1989 world would be premised on imitation of the American model of democracy. But this “imitation paradigm,” Krastev argued, proved risky for both sides. It has been harmful for the imitated—especially the US--because it has brought a loss of critical distance, a constant self-congratulation that inhibits self-improvement. Meanwhile, imitators have come to see the paradigm as a form of humiliation, a negation of national identity. </p>
                <p align='justify'>Many of the supposed advantages of the post-1989 world have turned out to be disadvantages. Open borders have fuelled radical nostalgia, as countries like Bulgaria experience such high levels of emigration that they feel that they are disappearing as nations. The use of English as the international lingua franca has discouraged Americans from learning foreign languages, limiting their experience and understanding of other countries. “America is becoming transparent to the world, but the world is not transparent to America,” Krastev said. </p>
                <p align='justify'>The imitation imperative has also engendered a certain cognitive dissonance. In the 1990s, Eastern European countries longed to be “normal”—i.e., like the West—but this discourse of normality carried a problematic double meaning. On one hand, “normal” is used to indicate what is morally right. On the other hand, “normal” means commonplace. In a place like Bulgaria, for example, to give and take bribes has remained commonplace—“normal”—while being the opposite of the normative Western model promoted by the imitation imperative. </p>
                <p align='justify'>This sense of contradiction has fostered more cynical types of imitation of the West, with Russia offering some of the most striking examples. Putin has used rigged elections not to establish legitimacy in the eyes of the West, but to persuade the Russian public that there is no alternative to his rule. When he lied about the presence of Russian troops in Crimea in 2014, he did not expect anyone to believe him. Instead, he wanted to compare his own lies to Western ones—for example, about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. In Putin’s hands, Krastev said, the imitation imperative becomes the idea that “I will do to you what you did to me, in order to show you that what you call order is really disorder.” Meanwhile, American anxiety about Trump as Putin’s Manchurian candidate follows Russia’s conspiratorial logic: every domestic problem is perceived as the result of an external threat. By playing into this reasoning, Krastev argued, Americans only aid Putin in his efforts to position himself as a powerful leader. </p>
                <p align='justify'>Today, imitation can no longer be understood as unilateral and purely beneficial. The post-1989 world order must be understood not only in terms of the Cold War, but in terms of what came after it. The Black Sea Networks initiative, Krastev said, will seek to reimagine the last 25 years in a way that will allow a better understanding of the present. </p>
