<p align="center"><b>THE IMITATION IMPERATIVE: MAKING SENSE OF THE CRISIS OF BLACK SEA EUROPE</b></p>
 
<p>Although the post-1989 world is the world that America and Europe made, it has now become 
the world that America and Europe have started to fear and sometimes even hate. Looking back 
across the turbulent decades since 1989, we are astounded by the speed with which yesterday’s 
euphoric victory has turned into today’s anxiety and distress. Explaining why and how it happened 
in the different parts of Black Sea Europe (Russia, Turkey, Eastern Europe) is the principal 
ambition of this lecture.</p>
<p><b>Ivan Krastev</b> is one the most visible public intellectuals in Europe today and an expert on 
Eastern European democracy. The Chairman of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, and 
Permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, Austria, he is a founding board member 
of the European Council on Foreign Relations and a member of the Board of Trustees of the International 
Crisis Group (2016&ndash;18). His books in English include <i>Democracy Disrupted: The Global Politics 
on Protest</i> (U Penn Press, May 2014), <i>In Mistrust We Trust: Can Democracy Survive When We Don't 
Trust Our Leaders?</i> (TED Books, 2013), <i>The Anti-American Century</i> (CEU Press, 2007), and 
<i>Shifting Obsessions: Three Essays on the Politics of Anticorruption</i> (CEU Press, 2004). Ivan 
Krastev is a contributing opinion writer of The New York Times. He is currently working, in collaboration 
with Stephen Holmes, on a book on Russian politics.</p>
