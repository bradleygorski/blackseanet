<li><h4>Exhibition "Ilia Zdanevich: The Tbilisi Years"</h4>
<p>March 7-July 12, 2019 | Chang Octagon Room, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University</p>
<div class="w3-row w3-center w3-padding-small"><img src="images/illazd_poster_final_web.jpg" style="width:70%" alt="">
			</div>

<p align='justify'>Tbilisi, Zdanevich's hometown, became a "fantastic" haven for artists of all stripes during the Russian Civil War.
In this multilingual environment where feuds among artistic schools had been suspended, Zdanevich worked out the principles
of "mature" <i>zaum</i> and a corresponding approach to book design.  This exhibition, curated by Thomas J. Kitson, begins
before the First World War with Zdanevich's apprenticeship as a propagandist for the Larionov group in competition with Futurist
rivals and proceeds through masterworks he designed and typeset as a founding member of 41 degrees.  We include a selection of
works by his brother and collaborator, Kirill, and a display of interconnected items associated with other poets, composers, and
visual artists who frequented the Fantastic Tavern, center of Tbilisi artistic life between 1917 and 1920.  The exhibition is part
of "Displacement and Display: The Ongoing Revolutions of Ilia Zdanevich," a <a href="https://fas.columbia.edu/news-highlights/news/2018-19-global-humanities-project-grants-and-columbia-psl-collaboration-grants">Global Humanities</a> project led by Professor Valentina
Izmirlieva (Slavic Department) and sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Humanities at Columbia University.  It is co-sponsored
by the Bakhmeteff Archive of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library and the Global Studies unit of the Columbia University Libraries
and opens on March 7th with a symposium, co-sponsored by the University Seminars.</p>

<p align='justify'>The “Black Sea Myths and Modern Europe” symposium addresses key ancient Black Sea myths that retain a stable presence in the 
Western cultural imagination—Prometheus, Medea and the Argonauts, Iphigenia, Odysseus—and aims to explore their 
life in the lands where these myths initially emerged. It targets especially the little-studied political 
mobilization of these myths in the construction of modern national, regional, and pan-European identities 
for various communities around the Black Sea. This symposium is the first public event of a long-term 
international research program, mobilizing an interdisciplinary team of scholars from the U.S., U.K., 
Greece, Bulgaria, and the Republic of Georgia under the umbrella of the global initiative Black Sea Networks, 
housed by the Slavic Department of Columbia University.</p>

<h2>CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<p align='justify'>On April 21st, the Cambridge Ukrainian Studies program held the workshop <b>“Crimea: Centre of Gravity in the Black Sea”</b> at the University of Cambridge, in partnership with the Black Sea Networks Initiative.</p>

<p align='justify'><b>Rory Finnin</b>, head of the Department of Slavonic Studies at University of Cambridge, explained that a central goal of the workshop was to combat “Crimnesia,” the tendency to ignore Crimea or relegate it to a marginal role in the history of many different countries and regions. As a peninsula connected to mainland Ukraine by a thin thread of land, Crimea can easily be misperceived as an island, beautiful but remote, far from the center of history or politics. But Crimea is central, Professor Finnin argued, to the project of Ukrainian history. Valentina Izmirlieva, Principle Investigator of Columbia University’s Black Sea Networks Initiative, noted that many different cultures, ethnicities, and religions have settled down in Crimea and then been pushed away. Like the Black Sea, Crimea is a site of fluidity and transience, a lack of fixed boundaries, and mingling of disparate elements.</p>

<p align='justify'>The workshop’s first panel, <b>“Centripetal Forces,”</b> opened with a presentation by <b>Idil Izmirli</b> (George Mason University), <b>“Variations on a Theme: Politics and Islam in Crimea before and after the Annexation.”</b> Professor Izmirli explained that although Islam emphasizes cohesion and camaraderie, there are a number of different narratives and tendencies among Ukrainian/Crimea Muslim organizations. Ukraine’s Muslim groups offer social, cultural, language, and education programs as well as religious ones; some of the organizations are positioned within a transnational Muslim community. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 dramatically changed the structure of the peninsula’s Muslim organizations, which were forced to re-register. Many Crimean Tatars left the peninsula because of the hostile political climate; home searches of Crimea Tatars continue to occur on a regular basis, along with detention without cause, forced stays in psychiatric hospitals, and other gross rights violations. Remaining Muslim leaders have refrained from criticizing the authorities. Despite the Russian Constitution’s assertion that there is no state religion, Orthodox Christianity is promoted in Crimea at the state level. Russian support for the construction or refurbishment of new mosques has obviously been a PR effort rather than a meaningful act of support. The annexation has had a profoundly negative effect on Crimea’s Muslim community. </p>

<p align='justify'><b>Hakan Kirimli</b> (Bilkent University) spoke about <b>“The Crimean Tatars in Russian-Occupied Crimea.”</b> The Crimean Tatars arrived in Crimea in the sixth century AD, developing a rich culture linked to that of the Krymchaks. When Russia annexed the peninsula in the 18th century, Crimean Tatars constituted most of Crimea’s population. The 1917 revolution saw a short-lived Crimean Tatar democracy. In 1944, Crimean Tatars were deported from Crimea en masse. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Crimean Tatars wholeheartedly supported Ukrainian independence and the inclusion of Crimea into Ukraine; during the 2014 Russian invasion, Crimean Tatars resisted energetically. Despite the failure of the post-Soviet Ukraine state to offer strong support to the Crimean Tatars, in Ukraine Crimean Tatars were free to express themselves, to create their own cultural and religious organizations, and to return to their homeland. Now they are experiencing severe repression under Russian rule, Kirimli said, and the liberation of Crimea is a question of life or death for Crimean Tatar culture. </p>

<p align='justify'><b>Eleanor Knott</b> (London School of Economics) presented on <b>“Discourses of Antagonism in Crimea before Annexation: ‘Discriminated’ Russians and Crimean Tatars.”</b> Beginning with the question of why Crimean Tatars have been the objects of persecution and repression since annexation, she pointed to the fractured meaning of “being Russian,” and the highly politicized, instrumental nature of the identity of Russians who perceive themselves as the victims of discrimination. This shift in power relations, in which members of a majority present themselves as victims while portraying an oppressed minority as the threat, represents a “discursive inversion” that is also relevant to Moldova and Romania, as well as to political movements in Western Europe and the US that portray white people or men, for example, as oppressed groups. In the case of Crimea, a constituency of “discriminated” Russians is usually involved in pro-Russian political organizations. Identifying strongly as Russian but feeling threatened by the Ukrainian state, they consider themselves victims of Ukrainization and attacks on Russian identity, and continue to nurture Soviet-era grievances, arguing, for example, that Stalin’s deportation of Crimean Tatars was appropriate. These “discriminated” Russians view the Crimean Tatars’ identification as indigenous people as an effort to exclude Russians. They promote the idea of Crimean Tatars as extremists, helping to escalate repression. This self-marginalization has proven an effective strategy, enabling people who considered themselves post-Soviet losers to become post-annexation winners. Knott contrasted the “discriminated Russians” with “ethnic Russians” who identify as Russian but don’t feel discriminated against; “political Ukrainians” who identify as citizens of Ukraine, regardless of their ethnic identity; “Crimeans” who identify primarily regionally and inter-ethnically, considering themselves in between Ukrainian and Russian; and “ethnic Ukrainians” who identify ethnically and linguistically as Ukrainian. Knott’s study results are analyzed in detail in her recent papers in <i><a href='http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13621025.2016.1252714'>Citizenship Studies</a></i>, <i><a href='http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0888325415584047'>East European Politics and Societies</a></i>, and <i><a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12193/abstract'>Social Science Quarterly</a></i>. </p>

<p align='justify'><b>Sait Ocakli</b> (Harvard University) discussed <b>“Turkish Perspectives on the Crimean Crisis.”</b> Turkey refrained from expressing a strong reaction to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Mustafa Dzhemilev, former Chairman of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis, asked President Erdogan to send Turkish warships to blockade Crimea, to close Turkish straits to Russian warships, and to join in sanctions against Russia. Erdogan said Turkey would not do this unless it was part of a larger NATO action; that Turkey would not join in sanctions because it was not an EU member; and that Turkey could help the Crimean Tatars more through continued dialogue with Russia. Turkey stopped flights to Crimea, but took no other steps. The Turkish public has been mostly indifferent to the Crimean crisis, taking the position that Turkey has no reason to become involved in a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Turkish pro-government media pushed a highly negative image of Maidan as a coup financed by George Soros and US and Euro imperialism. There were also some areas in which Turkey stood to benefit from the conflict. Turkish suppliers hoped to meet Russian food needs caused by European sanctions, while Putin’s suggestion of sending gas to Europe through Turkey rather than through Ukraine offered potential economic and political gains for Turkey. Turkey’s large Crimean Tatar community organized protests, but Crimean Tatars faced criticism within Turkey for their support of “Ukrainian fascists.” Turkey later agreed to stop the movement of warships from Turkey to Crimea, but this was probably an attempt to force Russia to remove sanctions on Turkey after Turkey shot down the Russian plane, not an attempt to join in EU/US punishment of Russia for annexation of Crimea. </p>

<p align='justify'>The workshop’s second panel, <b>“Centrifugal Forces,”</b> turned its attention from Islam, the Crimea Tatars, and Turkey to the significance of Crimea within Russian culture and politics. <b>Sophie Pinkham (Columbia University) presented on “Putin’s Crimea Rhetoric and Imperial Nostalgia.”</b> There are marked similarities between Putin’s rhetoric and that used in relation to Catherine the Great’s annexation of Crimea. Putin stresses Crimea’s status as a place of harmonious coexistence of many different ethnic and religious groups, a flattering “mirror of multi-ethnic Russia.” The annexation allowed Russia to assert its role as a benevolent defender of the rights of ethnic and religious minorities against the “Ukrainian fascists.” Crimea’s location makes it an important site of connection between Russia and its Slavic and Orthodox Christian friends in the Black Sea basin, thus helping to counterbalance American and NATO hegemony; the peninsula is also a place to discover and commemorate Russia’s history, identity, and prime position in Western and Orthodox culture. Along similar lines, Catherine’s annexation was framed as the establishment of Russia’s equality, or even superiority, to rival Western powers. Russia was savior of the oppressed, bringer of peace and tolerance. The similarities between Crimea rhetoric under Putin and Catherine offer a reminder that this particular conquest has cultural and historical roots that reach far beyond the Soviet period. Pinkham’s talk expanded on parts of her book <i><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Black-Square-Adventures-Post-Soviet-Ukraine/dp/039324797X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494186399&sr=8-1&keywords=sophie+pinkham'>Black Square: Adventures in Post-Soviet Ukraine</a></i> (Norton/Heinemann, 2016). </p>
<p align='justify'><b>Vsevolod Samokhvalov</b> (University of Liege) addressed the question of <b>“Why Crimea Is So Special: The Holy Grail of Russia’s Great Power Identity.”</b> Drawing on his new book, <i><a href='https://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9783319520773'>Russian-European Relations in the Balkans and Black Sea Region</a></i> (Palgrave, 2017), Samokhvalov opened with the principle that formative beliefs are formed in adolescence and early adulthood, including the sense of membership in an “imagined community.” He discussed some of the findings of his analysis of Soviet textbooks, which identify the Black Sea shores, and especially Crimea, as the site of the origin of Western civilization. Prince Vladimir’s baptism made Crimea the link between Russia and Europe and the basis of pan-European civilization. Crimea’s high concentration of “hero cities,” sites of major military battles, gives Crimea a special status in Russian military history and culture, the site on which many of Russia’s claims to great power status have been fought over the centuries. Meanwhile, the Black Sea functions, in the Soviet cultural imagination, as a locus of adventurous freedom and exotic adventures. It is striking, though, that the “Crimean Spring” of 2014 receives only one short paragraph in the new Russian history textbook; Crimea is already fading from view in contemporary Russia’s political narrative. </p>

<p align='justify'><b>Olga Zeveleva</b> (University of Cambridge) presented preliminary results of her 2017 fieldwork in Crimea in <b>“Media and Power in Crimea 2017: Notes from the Field.”</b> Since annexation, Crimean media production has come to be dominated by Russian state-supported media, with Ukrainian outlets gone. A Russian state-funded Crimean Tatar TV station, Millet, was created to compete with the longstanding Crimean Tatar station ATR, which has left Crimea but is still watched via satellite, in part due to an ATR campaign to install satellites in Crimean Tatar homes. It is very hard for any journalists not approved by Russia to operate—they cannot get press passes, are subject to apartment searches, and face other obstacles. Sevastopol and Simferopol are homes to different media fields, with Sevastopol operating as a discrete zone and Simferopol functioning as the center of the Crimean media; the two fields often come into conflict.  Crimean radio and television stations cannot show new content from abroad since media companies are unwilling to send new content to Crimea in fear of sanctions; this means a much greater reliance on older material. </p>

<p align='justify'>In a <b>concluding roundtable</b>, participants discussed some of the methodological questions raised by the study of Crimea, many of which also apply to Black Sea studies. How do we choose our historical timeframe and geographical boundaries? How do we work on a site in which traditional dichotomies of empire and nation-state do not apply? The peninsula offers a rich set of competing historical narratives; a metahistorical approach can help us to parse these narratives, isolate invented or politically manipulated elements, and interrogate our own preconceptions based on our areas of scholarly focus. As Franco Moretti observed, metaphors abound in unknown places. Crimea offers rich possibilities for the study of place and space within cultural and historical narratives. </p>

<p align='justify'>Participants agreed on the value of convening scholars from different disciplines and regions to discuss Crimea, and the importance of continuing and extending the discussion that began at the workshop. A future workshop or conference could begin with a call for papers, op-eds, etc., and could be tied to a Crimea-focused special issue of a journal.   Other ideas for future activities included the creation of a scholarly database of videos and other media related to the Crimean annexation/occupation, a large and valuable body of material that may disappear from YouTube and other websites without warning; the Columbia Academic Commons might be well suited for this. Ukrainian historians sometimes trace private family histories for pay; this information could also be archived in one place. </p>

<p align="justify">Publius Ovidius Naso, whose passing 2000 years ago is commemorated this year, 
has had a tremendous influence on literature, philosophy, and the arts throughout the two millennia 
since his death on the Black Sea shore. The conference will open with a short presentation of Ovid’s 
life, writings and allegations that caused his exile to the “bleak” Greek city, Tomis, in yr 9 A.D., 
and will continue with the poet’s legacy in Europe in general and in the Balkan area in particular. 
The talk will focus on exile and its effects, as a major theme that have inspired writers throughout 
centuries as well as on the reception of Ovid in the Balkan countries’ cultures through partial 
translations of his writings.</p>   

<p align="justify"><b>Dr. Adina Ciugureanu</b> is Professor of British and American culture at Ovidius University, 
Constanta, Romania and the Chair of the Institute of Doctoral Studies. Her research interest covers the Victorian 
and modernist ages in both Britain and the USA, with special focus on consumerism and, more recently, on 
geocriticism and urban studies. She has published five books and over 40 articles and volume chapters in 
reputed national and international academic journals and conference volumes. Following her first Fulbright 
grant (2001-2002) she authored a volume and individual articles on American popular culture. She has 
also edited and co-edited 8 conference volumes. Currently, she benefits from the second Fulbright grant 
at UCSB, doing research on cityscape, especially LA, and its representations in American fiction. Apart 
from Columbia, she will lecture at the Global Awareness Center at the Arkansas State University-Beebe.</p>

       <br>A Black Sea Networks Seminar</h4>
       <p>Convened by <b>Valentina Izmirlieva</b>
       <br>with <b>Gelina Harlaftis</b>, Professor of Maritime History, Ionian University, Greece
       <br>Friday, March 24, 2017 | 4:00pm-6:00pm | Columbia University | 707 International Affairs Building</p>

       <p align='justify'>How does one write the history of a Sea? The Black Sea regions share political economy, 
       trade, shipping, finance, industry, and cultures, linked together by land and sea routes. During the nineteenth 
       century, the area became the world's largest grain and oil producer. From the last third of the 18th century 
       to the beginning of the 20th century, more than 24 port cities sprang up on the coastline. These port cities 
       became centers of attraction for economic immigration from the whole region of central and south-eastern 
       Europe, while more established mobile, entrepreneurial groups like Greeks, Jews, and Armenians took charge 
       of external trade and shipping.</p>

	   <p align='justify'>Maritime history is unusual in placing the sea, its ports and its entrepreneurs at 
	   the centre of analysis, looking beyond national borders. Based on two research projects that ran from 
	   2007 to 2015 from Ionian University in Corfu, I will present the maritime history methodology that we 
	   used to research and write the Black Sea history. Some of the results will be presented, drawing on Eastern 
	   and Western European archives and academic networks with 20 universities and research centers from Greece, 
	   Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Turkey.</p>
       
       <p align='justify'><b>Gelina Harlaftis</b> is Professor of Maritime History in the Department of History of 
       Ionian University. She graduated from the University of Athens and completed her graduate studies at the 
       Universities of Cambridge (M.Phil.) and Oxford (D.Phil.). She was President of the International Maritime 
       Economic History Association (2004–2008) and visiting Fellow in universities of Canada, the United States 
       and the United Kingdom. She has led numerous research projects, the most recent being “The Black Sea and 
       its port cities, 1774-1914. Development, convergence and linkages with the global economy” within the 
       operational programme “Thalis,” co-financed by the European Union and the Greek Ministry of Education 
       from 2012–2015 (<a href="http://www.blacksea.gr">www.blacksea.gr</a>). Her most recent books are <i>Merchant ‘Colonies’ in the Early Modern 
       Period (15th–18th Centuries)</i> with Viktor Zakharov and Olga Katsiardi-Hering (Chatto & Pickering 2012), 
       <i>World’s Key Industry</i> with Jesus Valdaliso and Stig Tenold (Palgrave/Macmillan 2012), <i>Greek Shipping

       <p align='justify'>Join NYRB Poets for a celebration of the first US publication of Austerity Measures: 
       The New Greek Poetry, edited by Karen Van Dyck (The Scattered Papers of Penelope). Austerity Measures 
       collects the best, most provocative poetry written in the wake of the 2008 debt crisis that shook Greece 
       and the rest of the world. More recently, Greece has become one of the main channels into Europe for refugees 
       from poverty and war, an attendant reality that influences much of the poetry in this collection as well. At 
       this event, Van Dyck will be joined by Maria Margaronis of The Nation, Kurdish-Greek writer Hiva Panahi 
       (Secrets of the Snow), Greek-Albanian writer Gazmend Kapllani (A Short Border Handbook), and the poet Yusef 
       Komunyakaa (The Emperor of Water Clocks) for an evening of discussion and readings that will touch on the 
       intersection between poetry, translation, journalism, and the refugee experience.</p>

       <p align="justify"><b>Romantic Prosaics and Modern Armenian Culture: 
       <br>How to Read Khachatur Abovyan’s Wounds of Armenia, and Why</b>
       <br>Although no sovereign Armenian state existed from the fourteenth century until the twentieth, “Armenia” figured 
       quite prominently in Russian imperial public discourse, giving rise to a rhetorical formation that foregrounded the 
       ordinary and the domestic. The Russo-Persian War of 1826-28 prompted a multi-lingual, multi-generic response that included 
       historical and ethnographic writing, poetry and prose, and reportage. I propose to re-read Khachatur Abovyan’s chronicle of 
       the Russo-Persian war, <i>Wounds of Armenia </i> (finished circa 1841), the first major novel in the Eastern Armenian vernacular, 
       in an artistic, cultural and historical context, with attention to its reception in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and 
       beyond. A not-quite-historical-novel produced by a self-styled and self-consciously stateless Eurasian cultural tradition 
       that came to Romanticism rather late, <i>Wounds of Armenia</i> invites its reader to interrogate many of the familiar 
       categories of Romantic nationalism and literary modernity while looking both east- and westward from the Ararat valley of 
       the Armenian revivalist imagination.</p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Bella Grigoryan</b> is Associate Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale. 
       Her specific areas of research include the rise of the reading public and the periodical press, theory and 
       history of the novel, the history and politics of social estates in Imperial Russia, and modern Armenian literature 
       and culture from the late eighteenth century to the contemporary moment. Her first book, <i>Noble Subjects: The 
       Russian Novel and the Gentry, 1762-1861</i>, will be published by Northern Illinois University Press in 2017. </p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Migration, Translingualism, Translation</b>
       <br>Increasingly, literature asks how to translate the foreign accents and translingual idioms of the migrant. 
       Two contemporary Greek novellas create transliterative and homophonic spaces that are themselves translational. 
       Thanasis Valtinos’s <i>The Book of Andreas Kordopatis, Part One, America</i> (1964), represents early migration 
       with a story of a Greek making his way from his hometown in the Peloponnese to New Orleans, while Sotiris Dimitriou’s 
       <i>May Your Name be Blessed</i> (1993), addresses the more recent migration of a boy, born in Albania to Greek parents, 
       who returns to Greece when the communist regime ends. Both texts create shared linguistic spaces that resonate for two 
       or more communities, helping readers to rethink concepts of cultural belonging. Existing English translations of these 
       macaronic texts are contrasted with translations that introduce translingual sound patterning and intertextual references. 
       Comparative studies of translingualism in literature and translations can offer new categories for understanding migration 
       and enable fresh interventions into the debates on world literature, while also stimulating the development of inventive 
       translation practices. </p>

	fruit names were borrowed as the fruits themselves were bought and sold. If this hypothesis proves 
	inadequate, the non-coincidence of trade routes and linguistic spread could give rise to speculation 
	about alternative or previously unknown trade routes, about the (intentional) skewing of linguistic 
	data to conform to narratives of nationhood, or other possibilities.</p>

    <p align='justify'>The resulting data set will be made available to other scholars to employ in their

            While the Christian “Hajj” to Jerusalem emerged as an Ottoman phenomenon already in the 17th century, 
			     in the early 19th century it underwent a significant transformation. The hajjis began to 
			     travel “family style,” taking along not only their wives and male children, but also 
			     their elderly mothers and unmarried daughters of all age. Despite the dangers of the 
			     long trip, some took their new brides on a honeymoon pilgrimage so that their first 
			     child would be conceived in Jerusalem, and some even took their pregnant wives so that 
			     they would give birth in the Holy Land. The Orthodox Hajj to Jerusalem thus emerged as a 
			     family project and a surprising vehicle for female mobility, creativity, and empowerment. 
			     This talk will explore how this transformation occurred and why.</p>

           By the beginning of the 20th century, two-thirds of all pilgrims from the Russian Empire to the Holy Land were female. Their lived experience of pilgrimage involved 
            visits to the shrines and the associated devotional practices, but also everyday problems 
            and the unavoidable navigation around international diplomatic issues, local politics 
            and Greek-Russian relations of the time. In facing some or all of these challenges, 
            women pilgrims proved to be active agents, willing to antagonize constituted authority 
            in order to preserve a modicum of independent action. As such, they energetically pursued 
            their own version of the pilgrimage experience, above and beyond that envisioned by 
            Russian authorities in the Holy Land.</p>

                <p><i>text by Sophie Pinkham</i><br>
                <p align='justify'>On September 23rd, Ivan Krastev kicked off the Black Sea Networks initiative with a lecture entitled “The Imitation Imperative: Making Sense of the Crisis of Black Sea Europe.” Krastev, an expert on Eastern European democracy, called for a re-examination of the post-1989 world order, arguing that the model of universal imitation of Western liberal democracy has become a source of renewed nationalist and anti-globalist sentiment. Today, he argued, the most urgent question is not how the West is transforming the rest of the world, but how the West itself is being transformed. These questions are especially pertinent in the Black Sea region, at the intersection of the three empires—Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian—that constituted the European order until the end of the First World War.</p>
                <p align='justify'>According to Francis Fukuyama’s influential concept of the “end of history,” there were simply no alternatives to liberal democracy; the post-1989 world would be premised on imitation of the American model of democracy. But this “imitation paradigm,” Krastev argued, proved risky for both sides. It has been harmful for the imitated—especially the US--because it has brought a loss of critical distance, a constant self-congratulation that inhibits self-improvement. Meanwhile, imitators have come to see the paradigm as a form of humiliation, a negation of national identity. </p>
                <p align='justify'>Many of the supposed advantages of the post-1989 world have turned out to be disadvantages. Open borders have fuelled radical nostalgia, as countries like Bulgaria experience such high levels of emigration that they feel that they are disappearing as nations. The use of English as the international lingua franca has discouraged Americans from learning foreign languages, limiting their experience and understanding of other countries. “America is becoming transparent to the world, but the world is not transparent to America,” Krastev said. </p>
                <p align='justify'>The imitation imperative has also engendered a certain cognitive dissonance. In the 1990s, Eastern European countries longed to be “normal”—i.e., like the West—but this discourse of normality carried a problematic double meaning. On one hand, “normal” is used to indicate what is morally right. On the other hand, “normal” means commonplace. In a place like Bulgaria, for example, to give and take bribes has remained commonplace—“normal”—while being the opposite of the normative Western model promoted by the imitation imperative. </p>
                <p align='justify'>This sense of contradiction has fostered more cynical types of imitation of the West, with Russia offering some of the most striking examples. Putin has used rigged elections not to establish legitimacy in the eyes of the West, but to persuade the Russian public that there is no alternative to his rule. When he lied about the presence of Russian troops in Crimea in 2014, he did not expect anyone to believe him. Instead, he wanted to compare his own lies to Western ones—for example, about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. In Putin’s hands, Krastev said, the imitation imperative becomes the idea that “I will do to you what you did to me, in order to show you that what you call order is really disorder.” Meanwhile, American anxiety about Trump as Putin’s Manchurian candidate follows Russia’s conspiratorial logic: every domestic problem is perceived as the result of an external threat. By playing into this reasoning, Krastev argued, Americans only aid Putin in his efforts to position himself as a powerful leader. </p>
                <p align='justify'>Today, imitation can no longer be understood as unilateral and purely beneficial. The post-1989 world order must be understood not only in terms of the Cold War, but in terms of what came after it. The Black Sea Networks initiative, Krastev said, will seek to reimagine the last 25 years in a way that will allow a better understanding of the present. </p>

                <p>The Peoples' Movements Summer Convergence this July in Istanbul took place

                and its immediate aftermath. While we had chosen Istanbul as the site of our 
                convergence in part out of recognition of the city's centrality to current 
                conflicts and in solidarity with Turkey's deeply embattled leftist community, 
                none of us could have guessed just how germane our plan for discussion would be 
                to current events.</p>
