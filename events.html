       <li><h4>LITERATURES ACROSS BORDERS: ARMENIANS AND GREEKS
       <br>A Black Sea Networks Seminar</h4>
       <p>with Bella Grigoryan (Yale University) and Karen Van Dyck (Columbia University)
       <br>Thursday, February 16, 2017 4:00-6:00 pm | Hamilton 709, Columbia University</p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Romantic Prosaics and Modern Armenian Culture: How to read Khachatur Abovyan’s Wounds of Armenia, 
       and Why</b>
       <br>Although no sovereign Armenian state existed from the fourteenth century until the twentieth, “Armenia” figured 
       quite prominently in Russian imperial public discourse, giving rise to a rhetorical formation that foregrounded the 
       ordinary and the domestic. The Russo-Persian War of 1826-28 prompted a multi-lingual, multi-generic response that included 
       historical and ethnographic writing, poetry and prose, and reportage. I propose to re-read Khachatur Abovyan’s chronicle of 
       the Russo-Persian war, <i>Wounds of Armenia </i> (finished circa 1841), the first major novel in the Eastern Armenian vernacular, 
       in an artistic, cultural and historical context, with attention to its reception in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and 
       beyond. A not-quite-historical-novel produced by a self-styled and self-consciously stateless Eurasian cultural tradition 
       that came to Romanticism rather late, <i>Wounds of Armenia</i> invites its reader to interrogate many of the familiar 
       categories of Romantic nationalism and literary modernity while looking both east- and westward from the Ararat valley of 
       the Armenian revivalist imagination.</p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Bella Grigoryan</b> is Associate Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale. 
       Her specific areas of research include the rise of the reading public and the periodical press, theory and 
       history of the novel, the history and politics of social estates in Imperial Russia, and modern Armenian literature 
       and culture from the late eighteenth century to the contemporary moment. Her first book, <i>Noble Subjects: The 
       Russian Novel and the Gentry, 1762-1861</i>, will be published by Northern Illinois University Press in 2017. </p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Migration, Translingualism, Translation</b>
       <br>Increasingly, literature asks how to translate the foreign accents and translingual idioms of the migrant. 
       Two contemporary Greek novellas create transliterative and homophonic spaces that are themselves translational. 
       Thanasis Valtinos’s <i>The Book of Andreas Kordopatis, Part One, America</i> (1964), represents early migration 
       with a story of a Greek making his way from his hometown in the Peloponnese to New Orleans, while Sotiris Dimitriou’s 
       <i>May Your Name be Blessed</i> (1993), addresses the more recent migration of a boy, born in Albania to Greek parents, 
       who returns to Greece when the communist regime ends. Both texts create shared linguistic spaces that resonate for two 
       or more communities, helping readers to rethink concepts of cultural belonging. Existing English translations of these 
       macaronic texts are contrasted with translations that introduce translingual sound patterning and intertextual references. 
       Comparative studies of translingualism in literature and translations can offer new categories for understanding migration 
       and enable fresh interventions into the debates on world literature, while also stimulating the development of inventive 
       translation practices. </p>
       
       <p align="justify"><b>Karen Van Dyck</b> is Kimon A. Doukas Professor of Modern Greek Literature in the Classics Department 
       at Columbia University. Her books include <i>Kassandra and the Censors: Greek Poetry since 1967</i>, <i>The Rehearsal of 
       Misunderstanding: Three Collections by Contemporary Greek Women Poets</i>, <i>The Scattered Papers of Penelope: New and 
       Selected Poems by Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke</i>, and the bilingual anthology <i>Austerity Measures: The New Greek Poetry</i>. 
       Her current research focuses on the literature of the Greek Diaspora and its lessons for translation.</p>

	<p align='justify'>Our research-a-thon will compile a database that shows when the words for fruits 
	and vegetables entered the various Black Sea languages. This data set will allow us to map the spread 
	of these linguistic units against known Black Sea trade routes, to see whether, as one might expect, 
	fruit names were borrowed as the fruits themselves were bought and sold. If this hypothesis proves 
	inadequate, the non-coincidence of trade routes and linguistic spread could give rise to speculation 
	about alternative or previously unknown trade routes, about the (intentional) skewing of linguistic 
	data to conform to narratives of nationhood, or other possibilities.</p>

    <p align='justify'>The resulting data set will be made available to other scholars to employ in their 
    own research, expand to adjacent regions, or re-imagine in other ways. Our visualizations will be

		     <p align="justify"><b>"Hajji Mama": Christian Pilgrimage and Female Empowerment in the Late Ottoman Empire</b><br>
            While the Christian “Hajj” to Jerusalem emerged as an Ottoman phenomenon already in the 17th century, 
			     in the early 19th century it underwent a significant transformation. The hajjis began to 
			     travel “family style,” taking along not only their wives and male children, but also 
			     their elderly mothers and unmarried daughters of all age. Despite the dangers of the 
			     long trip, some took their new brides on a honeymoon pilgrimage so that their first 
			     child would be conceived in Jerusalem, and some even took their pregnant wives so that 
			     they would give birth in the Holy Land. The Orthodox Hajj to Jerusalem thus emerged as a 
			     family project and a surprising vehicle for female mobility, creativity, and empowerment. 
			     This talk will explore how this transformation occurred and why.</p>

           By the beginning of the 20th century, two-thirds of all pilgrims from the Russian Empire to the Holy Land were female. Their lived experience of pilgrimage involved 
            visits to the shrines and the associated devotional practices, but also everyday problems 
            and the unavoidable navigation around international diplomatic issues, local politics 
            and Greek-Russian relations of the time. In facing some or all of these challenges, 
            women pilgrims proved to be active agents, willing to antagonize constituted authority 
            in order to preserve a modicum of independent action. As such, they energetically pursued 
            their own version of the pilgrimage experience, above and beyond that envisioned by 
            Russian authorities in the Holy Land.</p>

 <li><h4>THE IMITATION IMPERATIVE: <br>MAKING SENSE OF THE CRISIS OF BLACK SEA EUROPE<span class="people-bio-button" title="Toggle Bio">▼</span>
 </h4>
 
 <p>A Public Lecture by Ivan Krastev
 <br>September 23, 2016 | Columbia University</p>
 <div class="people-bio">

                <p></p>
                <p><i>text by Sophie Pinkham</i><br>
                <p align='justify'>On September 23rd, Ivan Krastev kicked off the Black Sea Networks initiative with a lecture entitled “The Imitation Imperative: Making Sense of the Crisis of Black Sea Europe.” Krastev, an expert on Eastern European democracy, called for a re-examination of the post-1989 world order, arguing that the model of universal imitation of Western liberal democracy has become a source of renewed nationalist and anti-globalist sentiment. Today, he argued, the most urgent question is not how the West is transforming the rest of the world, but how the West itself is being transformed. These questions are especially pertinent in the Black Sea region, at the intersection of the three empires—Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian—that constituted the European order until the end of the First World War.</p>
                <p align='justify'>According to Francis Fukuyama’s influential concept of the “end of history,” there were simply no alternatives to liberal democracy; the post-1989 world would be premised on imitation of the American model of democracy. But this “imitation paradigm,” Krastev argued, proved risky for both sides. It has been harmful for the imitated—especially the US--because it has brought a loss of critical distance, a constant self-congratulation that inhibits self-improvement. Meanwhile, imitators have come to see the paradigm as a form of humiliation, a negation of national identity. </p>
                <p align='justify'>Many of the supposed advantages of the post-1989 world have turned out to be disadvantages. Open borders have fuelled radical nostalgia, as countries like Bulgaria experience such high levels of emigration that they feel that they are disappearing as nations. The use of English as the international lingua franca has discouraged Americans from learning foreign languages, limiting their experience and understanding of other countries. “America is becoming transparent to the world, but the world is not transparent to America,” Krastev said. </p>
                <p align='justify'>The imitation imperative has also engendered a certain cognitive dissonance. In the 1990s, Eastern European countries longed to be “normal”—i.e., like the West—but this discourse of normality carried a problematic double meaning. On one hand, “normal” is used to indicate what is morally right. On the other hand, “normal” means commonplace. In a place like Bulgaria, for example, to give and take bribes has remained commonplace—“normal”—while being the opposite of the normative Western model promoted by the imitation imperative. </p>
                <p align='justify'>This sense of contradiction has fostered more cynical types of imitation of the West, with Russia offering some of the most striking examples. Putin has used rigged elections not to establish legitimacy in the eyes of the West, but to persuade the Russian public that there is no alternative to his rule. When he lied about the presence of Russian troops in Crimea in 2014, he did not expect anyone to believe him. Instead, he wanted to compare his own lies to Western ones—for example, about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. In Putin’s hands, Krastev said, the imitation imperative becomes the idea that “I will do to you what you did to me, in order to show you that what you call order is really disorder.” Meanwhile, American anxiety about Trump as Putin’s Manchurian candidate follows Russia’s conspiratorial logic: every domestic problem is perceived as the result of an external threat. By playing into this reasoning, Krastev argued, Americans only aid Putin in his efforts to position himself as a powerful leader. </p>
                <p align='justify'>Today, imitation can no longer be understood as unilateral and purely beneficial. The post-1989 world order must be understood not only in terms of the Cold War, but in terms of what came after it. The Black Sea Networks initiative, Krastev said, will seek to reimagine the last 25 years in a way that will allow a better understanding of the present. </p>

<li><h4>LeftEast Summer Convergence<span class="people-bio-button" title="Toggle Bio">▼</span>
            </h4><p>August 15–19, 2016 | Boğaziçi University, Istanbul 
            
            <div class="people-bio">
                <p>The Peoples' Movements Summer Convergence this July in Istanbul took place 
                under uniquely arresting circumstances: amidst an unsuccessful military coup 
                and its immediate aftermath. While we had chosen Istanbul as the site of our 
                convergence in part out of recognition of the city's centrality to current 
                conflicts and in solidarity with Turkey's deeply embattled leftist community, 
                none of us could have guessed just how germane our plan for discussion would be 
                to current events.</p>
