			<h3>Impact</h3>
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea Networks initiative is designed as an intervention: we propose to 
			rethink the Slavic Languages and Literatures model through the larger connective 
			framework of “an open sea.” As a result, we hope to accelerate a much-needed opening 
			of our programs beyond traditional territorial and methodological constraints, 
			and to help foster a new generation of Slavists, with a vision of the field and 
			its mission that speaks directly to the concerns of our global age.</p>
			<p align='justify'>A guiding principle of this project is the recognition that to successfully meet 
			global challenges, we must learn to recognize and work with religious, cultural, 
			and linguistic diversity. The global challenges of the contemporary world require 
			competencies in dealing with the complexities of local contexts in which ordinary 
			people lead their lives. Taking globalization seriously, in other words, impels 
			us to cultivate a dual vision: while keeping an eye on macro-concerns, we need 
			to investigate multiple micro-contexts. Creating educational and research programs 
			that target the diversity of cultural practices in a highly strategic contact zone, 
			such as the Black Sea, is directly congruent with this agenda.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The initiative will develop open-access multi-media tools and reusable course 
			modules, pioneer the repurposing of available educational technologies, and integrate 
			curricular innovations implemented during the regular academic year with the summer 
			program in Istanbul, thus building toward a fully sustainable and dynamic program. 
			Through partnerships with NYU and Yale and through classroom sharing among consortium 
			institutions, we plan to create possibilities for shared curricular development 
			at other leading institutions, maximizing our impact on the field as a whole.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Finally, as a project focused on the study of networks, our initiative creates 
			new opportunities for expanding the existing educational and strategic networks of 
			Columbia University. Our planned activities will initiate research streams and new 
			lines of collaboration both on the New York campus and at the Global Centers in 
			Istanbul and Paris.</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p align='justify'>The Slavic field was conceived around the nineteenth-century Russian political 
			concept of a unified “Slavdom.” Pan-Slavism, heavily indebted to the German Romantic 
			philosophy of language, proclaimed the common identity of the Slavic peoples on the 
			basis of ethnic and linguistic kinship, ultimately calling for their political unification. 
			This idea became an important rhetorical tool for the late Russian Empire and was revived 
			by the Soviet Union as a rationale for maintaining political and military control over most 
			Slavic countries between 1945 and 1991.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Slavic studies developed as the academic counterpart to this political project. Built 
			upon the myth of Slavic cultural homogeneity, this field imagines coherence where there 
			is little beyond linguistic fraternity, downplaying significant distinctions among the 
			political and cultural histories of the three Slavic groups: Eastern (Russian, Ukrainian, 
			Belorussian), Balkan (Bulgarian, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian, Slovenian), and 
			Central European (Polish, Czech, Slovak). Cold War political considerations in the U.S. 
			reinforced this problematic structure in the 1950s, when developing Slavic studies&mdash;
			re-purposed as the study of Communist Russia and its sphere of influence&mdash;became a 
			national priority. Significantly, the Cold War legacy of the field is also a legacy of 
			insularity, as if the physical wall that divided generations of American Slavists from 
			their object of study became part of their identity. This systemic problem of self-isolation 
			persists, even though its source has been long removed; but the need to correct it has never 
			been more urgent than in our increasingly interconnected world. In the 1950s, Columbia 
			University set the standard for Slavic programs in the U.S. With the Black Sea Networks 
			Initiative, our institution is taking pioneering role once again and ushering in a new 
			era for the field in the global age.</p>

			<h3>Objectives and Advantages</h3> 
			<p align='justify'>We propose to rethink the outdated Slavic model within the larger framework of the 
			Black Sea&mdash;that critical waterway at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the 
			Middle East that Evliya Celebi once called “the mother of all seas.” The Black Sea 
			model has the intellectual advantage of being water-based. Unlike traditional 
			land-based area studies that are focused on divisions&mdash;on fixed and heavily 
			contested boundaries&mdash;the rise of the “new thalassology”  has shifted emphasis 
			toward patterns of connectivity, mobility, and exchange. By allowing us to bypass 
			national boundaries, these water-based studies subvert old imperial hierarchies and 
			expose “the myth of continents” (Lewis and Wigen 1997). The thriving Mediterranean 
			field (Horden and Purcell 2000, 2013) exemplifies the heuristic possibilities of the 
			recent “maritime turn.” David Abulafia (2005) has generalized the concept of the 
			Mediterranean, in its strict meaning of “inland sea,” to a range of areas over which 
			trade and communication have been comparatively intense, and Charles King (2004) has 
			championed this approach in his landmark history of the Black Sea. The river Danube’s 
			function as a connective conduit has similarly suggested transferable lessons of 
			transcultural co-existence beyond area-studies (Magris 1986; Payne 2013).</p>
			<p align='justify'>While the traditional Slavic model is predicated on singularity and exceptionalism, 
			which feeds the self-referentiality of the field and its resultant isolation, the 
			Black Sea model is based on the assumption of interconnectedness. Instead of asking 
			how Slavs are distinct from their neighbors, we ask to explore how they are inseparable 
			from the shifting contexts they share with others.</p>
			<p align='justify'>In sum, far from replacing one regionalism with another, the Black Sea model 
			calls for a cognitive reorientation of Slavic studies from a <i>shared identity</i>&mdash;constructed 
			as homogenous&mdash;toward a <i>shared space</i> of ethnic, linguistic, 
			religious and cultural heterogeneity where communities and individuals are bound by 
			durable links of conflict, cooperation, competition, and uneasy condominium. </p>
			<p align='justify'>We envision the Black Sea as an <i>open sea</i>, connected along waterways and 
			land routes: eastward, to China (along the Silk Road and its latest reinventions by 
			Chinese subsidies for new transit infrastructure through Central Asia to Anatolia); 
			southward, to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea; westward along the Danube, 
			to the heart of Central Europe; northward, to the Baltic Sea and beyond. The possibilities 
			for the study of long-distance interaction are as promising as the possibilities 
			for new comparisons and juxtapositions. The Black Sea networks of travel, communication, 
			and exchange reach far and wide and reveal new valences of “Slavic” that help us 
			redefine the way we frame the place of the Slavic peoples and their cultures in a 
			truly global history.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea framework thus offers distinct conceptual and curricular advantages, 
			while losing nothing of the political relevance that Slavic Studies commanded during 
			the Cold War. The “Wider Black Sea Region,” stretching from the Balkans to the Caucasus 
			and from the Russian and Ukrainian steppes to Anatolia (King 2008), is already 
			a political fact embodied in the <a href=“http://www.bsec-organization.org/Pages/homepage.aspx”>
			Black Sea Economic Cooperation Forum</a>, founded in 1992 and comprising twelve states. 
			As a buffer zone between Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East, and the scene of 
			ongoing political and ecologic crises with global repercussions, it constitutes the 
			next frontier of European strategic thinking. Meanwhile, comprehensive understanding 
			of the region is conspicuously lacking. Over the last decade, Black Sea educational programs 
			have emerged in both the region and the E.U. (in Turkey, Greece, Germany, including an 
			EU-wide program based in France). This is the first U.S. equivalent.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea Networks teaching and learning initiative at Columbia University 
			aims to re-conceptualize existing programs within a Black Sea framework and create 
			multidisciplinary tracks in “Black Sea Studies” at Columbia’s Department of Slavic 
			Languages. The initiative will foster new bonds among Slavic Studies, the Hellenic 
			Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, and East Asian Studies; it will also create 
			opportunities for establishing innovative interdisciplinary programs of study, 
			such as Black Sea Studies and Environmental Science, or Black Sea Studies and 
			Economics (with an emphasis on Energy Security). The study of the “open sea” 
			will help create a more open Slavic field, well positioned to initiate new forms 
			of cooperation and exchange.</p>
