			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p align='justify'>The Slavic field was conceived around the nineteenth-century Russian political 
			concept of a unified “Slavdom.” Pan-Slavism, heavily indebted to the German Romantic 
			philosophy of language, proclaimed the common identity of the Slavic peoples on the 
			basis of ethnic and linguistic kinship, ultimately calling for their political unification. 
			This idea became an important rhetorical tool for the late Russian Empire and was revived 
			by the Soviet Union as a rationale for maintaining political and military control over most 
			Slavic countries between 1945 and 1991.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Slavic studies developed as the academic counterpart to this political project. Built 
			upon the myth of Slavic cultural homogeneity, this field imagines coherence where there 
			is little beyond linguistic fraternity, downplaying significant distinctions among the 
			political and cultural histories of the three Slavic groups: Eastern (Russian, Ukrainian, 
			Belorussian), Balkan (Bulgarian, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian, Slovenian), and 
			Central European (Polish, Czech, Slovak). Cold War political considerations in the U.S. 
			reinforced this problematic structure in the 1950s, when developing Slavic studies&mdash;
			re-purposed as the study of Communist Russia and its sphere of influence&mdash;became a 
			national priority. Significantly, the Cold War legacy of the field is also a legacy of 
			insularity, as if the physical wall that divided generations of American Slavists from 
			their object of study became part of their identity. This systemic problem of self-isolation 
			persists, even though its source has been long removed; but the need to correct it has never 
			been more urgent than in our increasingly interconnected world. In the 1950s, Columbia 
			University set the standard for Slavic programs in the U.S. With the Black Sea Networks 
			Initiative, our institution is taking pioneering role once again and ushering in a new 
			era for the field in the global age.</p>

			<h3>Objectives and Advantages</h3> 
			<p align='justify'>We propose to rethink the outdated Slavic model within the larger framework of the 
			Black Sea&mdash;that critical waterway at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the 
			Middle East that Evliya Celebi once called “the mother of all seas.” The Black Sea 
			model has the intellectual advantage of being water-based. Unlike traditional 
			land-based area studies that are focused on divisions&mdash;on fixed and heavily 
			contested boundaries&mdash;the rise of the “new thalassology”  has shifted emphasis 
			toward patterns of connectivity, mobility, and exchange. By allowing us to bypass 
			national boundaries, these water-based studies subvert old imperial hierarchies and 
			expose “the myth of continents” (Lewis and Wigen 1997). The thriving Mediterranean 
			field (Horden and Purcell 2000, 2013) exemplifies the heuristic possibilities of the 
			recent “maritime turn.” David Abulafia (2005) has generalized the concept of the 
			Mediterranean, in its strict meaning of “inland sea,” to a range of areas over which 
			trade and communication have been comparatively intense, and Charles King (2004) has 
			championed this approach in his landmark history of the Black Sea. The river Danube’s 
			function as a connective conduit has similarly suggested transferable lessons of 
			transcultural co-existence beyond area-studies (Magris 1986; Payne 2013).</p>
			<p align='justify'>While the traditional Slavic model is predicated on singularity and exceptionalism, 
			which feeds the self-referentiality of the field and its resultant isolation, the 
			Black Sea model is based on the assumption of interconnectedness. Instead of asking 
			how Slavs are distinct from their neighbors, we ask to explore how they are inseparable 
			from the shifting contexts they share with others.</p>
			<p align='justify'>In sum, far from replacing one regionalism with another, the Black Sea model 
			calls for a cognitive reorientation of Slavic studies from a <i>shared identity</i>&mdash;
			constructed as homogenous&mdash;toward a <i>shared space</i> of ethnic, linguistic, 
			religious and cultural heterogeneity where communities and individuals are bound by 
			durable links of conflict, cooperation, competition, and uneasy condominium. </p>
			<p align='justify'>We envision the Black Sea as an <i>open sea</i>, connected along waterways and 
			land routes: eastward, to China (along the Silk Road and its latest reinventions by 
			Chinese subsidies for new transit infrastructure through Central Asia to Anatolia); 
			southward, to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea; westward along the Danube, 
			to the heart of Central Europe; northward, to the Baltic Sea and beyond. The possibilities 
			for the study of long-distance interaction are as promising as the possibilities 
			for new comparisons and juxtapositions. The Black Sea networks of travel, communication, 
			and exchange reach far and wide and reveal new valences of “Slavic” that help us 
			redefine the way we frame the place of the Slavic peoples and their cultures in a 
			truly global history.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea framework thus offers distinct conceptual and curricular advantages, 
			while losing nothing of the political relevance that Slavic Studies commanded during 
			the Cold War. The “Wider Black Sea Region,” stretching from the Balkans to the Caucasus 
			and from the Russian and Ukrainian steppes to Anatolia (King 2008), is already 
			a political fact embodied in the <a href=“http://www.bsec-organization.org/Pages/homepage.aspx”>
			Black Sea Economic Cooperation Forum</a>, founded in 1992 and comprising twelve states. 
			As a buffer zone between Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East, and the scene of 
			ongoing political and ecologic crises with global repercussions, it constitutes the 
			next frontier of European strategic thinking. Meanwhile, comprehensive understanding 
			of the region is conspicuously lacking. Over the last decade, Black Sea educational programs 
			have emerged in both the region and the E.U. (in Turkey, Greece, Germany, including an 
			EU-wide program based in France). This is the first U.S. equivalent.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea Networks teaching and learning initiative at Columbia University 
			aims to re-conceptualize existing programs within a Black Sea framework and create 
			multidisciplinary tracks in “Black Sea Studies” at Columbia’s Department of Slavic 
			Languages. The initiative will foster new bonds among Slavic Studies, the Hellenic 
			Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, and East Asian Studies; it will also create 
			opportunities for establishing innovative interdisciplinary programs of study, 
			such as Black Sea Studies and Environmental Science, or Black Sea Studies and 
			Economics (with an emphasis on Energy Security). The study of the “open sea” 
			will help create a more open Slavic field, well positioned to initiate new forms 
			of cooperation and exchange.</p>

			<h3>Overview of Activities</h3>
			<p align='justify'>While the long-term goals of this initiative are curricular reforms based on 
			rethinking the existing Slavic programs at Columbia University, our immediate 
			objective is to prepare these changes through:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>network-building,</li>
			    <li>research-driven curricular innovations, </li>
			    <li>development of multi-media teaching resources.</li>
			</ul>
			<p align='justify'>To create new lines of collaboration at Columbia, across the Morningside campus 
			and the Global Centers in Istanbul and Paris, and to help sustain intellectual 
			focus during the 2016&ndash;17 academic year, we are convening a <b>yearlong workshop on 
			Black Sea Studies</b>.  It meets on a monthly basis at Columbia or Yale and encompasses 
			working sessions, panel discussions, webinars, lectures, and other events to foster 
			creative exchange among our team, the advisory board, scholars at Columbia across 
			divisions, and outside experts, artists, and activists. Each workshop installment 
			will target a particular discipline (history, art history, film studies) or existing 
			interdisciplinary collaborations (e.g. the Danube project at Yale) and relate to specific 
			courses or curriculum initiatives. In May, we will conclude the academic year with an 
			interdisciplinary symposium on Crimea at Cambridge University, co-sponsored by the 
			Cambridge Committee for Russian and East European Studies.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The 2017&ndash;18 academic year will kick off with <b>a flagship two-day conference 
			at Columbia</b> in September 2017. The chief intended product of the workshop is a 
			special issue of the journal <i>Southeast European and Black Sea Studies</i> that 
			will further publicize our vision and help build the emerging field. This second 
			crucial year for our project we be focused on developing <b>a team-taught Global 
			Core course, “Black Sea Cultural Capitals,”</b> under the umbrella of the new 
			Humanities project “Cities of Knowledge: Reading the Global Metropolis.” The course 
			will include seven modules: six focused on a single city (Istanbul, Plovdiv, Belgrade, 
			Constanţa, Odessa, and Tbilisi), and one on the Crimean peninsula. We aim to pioneer 
			use of technologies currently employed exclusively for language acquisition through 
			the Mellon-sponsored Columbia-Cornell-Yale shared course initiative, and to create 
			an open-access digital library for Black Sea Studies that will support a future 
			multi-media publication. </p>
			<p align='justify'>We will conclude with <b>a summit at Columbia Global Centers&mdash;Paris</b> 
			that will:
			<ul>
			    <li>present the results of the project to our partners in the Black Sea region 
			    and representatives of Global Centers with potential stakes in the project (Istanbul, 
			    Paris, Amman, Beijing), </li>
			    <li>publicize advantages of the new research and teaching models we have initiated, </li>
			    <li>open lines for further collaborations.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Collaboration with Global Centers</h3>
			<p align='justify'>Columbia Global Centers&ndash;Turkey, strategically positioned in Istanbul on the 
			waterway between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, will play a key role in the proposed 
			initiative. The Center creates singular opportunities for engaging directly with the larger 
			Black Sea region through existing networks among researchers, educational and cultural 
			institutions, and private stakeholders, while serving as a hub for building new ones.</p> 
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea project is the natural outgrowth of the <a href=“https://columbia.studioabroad.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10878”>
			Slavic Department’s summer program in Balkan Transcultural Studies in Istanbul</a>, 
			developed as part of the Mellon Global Liberal Arts Initiative in partnership with the 
			History Department at Boğaziçi University. This program provides a useful model for 
			future curricular development through cross-institutional and cross-departmental 
			cooperation  (in the form of international programs, shared or team-taught courses, 
			dual mentorship programs, T.A. and internship opportunities for graduate students). 
			Columbia Global Centers&ndash;Turkey has been invaluable in helping us establish 
			strong working relations with scholars and institutions in Istanbul for the needs 
			of the summer program. We plan to transfer lessons learned from our cooperation with 
			Global Centers&ndash;Turkey in building a similarly close relationship with Global 
			Centers&ndash;Europe. We plan on using the expanding facilities of the two centers 
			as venues for meetings and other events, drawing from their existing audiences while 
			helping to widen their scope. Our initiative also aims to provide continuity and 
			coherence between events organized or hosted by the Centers in Istanbul and Paris 
			and activities at Columbia, thus opening new opportunities for them to integrate 
			directly into educational and research life on our New York campus. Most importantly, 
			we hope to be able to assist them in their current mission to be truly <i>regional</i> 
			in their outreach.</p>
			
			<a name="team"></a><p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
			
			<h3>The Team</h3>
			<p align='justify'>The core team consists of an intermural collaboration between three leading Slavic 
			departments: Columbia, Yale, and NYU. We realize that the desired reorientation of 
			the Slavic field cannot be accomplished by a single department but requires coordinated 
			efforts and a shared vision. Principal investigator Valentina Izmirlieva (Columbia), 
			Marijeta Bozovic (Yale), and Rossen Djagalov (NYU) draw on the unique strengths and 
			resources of their home institutions in the service of building a model of Black Sea 
			Studies that is analytically deep, yet scalable and agile. These three leading members 
			are joined by Catherine Evtuhov (Professor of History, Columbia), who has pioneered 
			curricular innovations with Black Sea history courses at Georgetown University; and 
			by two renowned international participants: Yonca Köksal (Associate Professor of History, 
			Koç University, Turkey) and Cleo Protokhristova (Professor of Comparative Literature, 
			Plovdiv University, Bulgaria). Professors Köksal and Protokhristova manage collaborative 
			programs and events in the region itself and help us cultivate durable partnerships there.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea Networks initiative is future-oriented at its core, aiming toward 
			the reorientation of the field and development of new programs. That is why many of 
			its participants are early career scholars: graduate students at the Slavic Department 
			and junior faculty. We see this composition of the team as its strength&mdash;and also 
			as a welcome opportunity for mentoring. To accomplish this goal, the team includes an 
			Advisory Board of esteemed scholars and experts highly experienced in program and 
			institution building. Their vision and know-how provides invaluable assets as they 
			guide the team, help mentor junior members, and assist with strategic networking. 
			Finally, our Support Team of highly qualified specialists in new media research 
			and educational technologies, digital humanities, and library development will 
			ensure that we can indeed develop the planned cutting-edge innovations and integrate 
			them into a sustainable program.</p>
			
			<a name="partners"></a><p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
			
			<h3>Partners</h3>
			<p align='justify'>A key partner for this initiative is the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. 
			As a leading academic institution focused on Russian, Eurasian, and East European 
			studies, the Institute has a serious investment in the Black Sea region. The Harriman 
			Institute has pledged substantive financial and staff support to the project and has 
			generously offered the team access to its extensive networks. In turn, the Black Sea 
			initiative offers the Harriman an opportunity to integrate better with the work of the 
			Global Centers in Istanbul and Paris and to expand its relationship with them into a 
			strategic partnership.</p>
			<p align='justify'>We have cultivated strong ties with American Councils for International Education 
			(Washington D.C), a premier institution for academic exchange with extensive networks 
			and offices in all countries of the wider Black Sea region. While preparing the Black 
			Sea Cultural Capitals course, our team has begun exploring possibilities for partnership 
			with a variety of cultural, social, and educational institutions across New York City 
			with roots and stakes in the Black Sea region. Building relationships with consulates 
			and UN representatives of the Black Sea littoral states is particularly important. No 
			less crucial will be partnerships with universities, libraries, museums, and research 
			centers in the region itself. Especially vital for our success is collaboration with 
			universities in Istanbul (Boğaziçi, Koç) and with Plovdiv University, the chief educational 
			institution in the city that is not only one of our “Balkan Cultural Capitals” but will 
			also be the European Capital of Culture in 2019, when we plan to launch the course.</p>
			<p align='justify'>At the same time, the team will draw on the rich resources available at Columbia, 
			from human and intellectual to printed, digital, and new media, and will further its 
			agenda by working with other parts of the university, specifically the Center for 
			Teaching and Learning, the Language Resource Center, and the Columbia Libraries, 
			including their Digital Humanities and Social Science Centers and the Bakhmeteff 
			Archive. The larger initiative will likewise establish lasting partnerships and 
			collaborations with Slavic departments at other universities, but especially at 
			Yale and New York Universities with which Columbia has existing consortiums.</p>
			
			<a name="impact"></a><p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
			
			<h3>Impact</h3>
			<p align='justify'>The Black Sea Networks initiative is designed as an intervention: we propose to 
			rethink the Slavic Languages and Literatures model through the larger connective 
			framework of “an open sea.” As a result, we hope to accelerate a much-needed opening 
			of our programs beyond traditional territorial and methodological constraints, 
			and to help foster a new generation of Slavists, with a vision of the field and 
			its mission that speaks directly to the concerns of our global age.</p>
			<p align='justify'>A guiding principle of this project is the recognition that to successfully meet 
			global challenges, we must learn to recognize and work with religious, cultural, 
			and linguistic diversity. The global challenges of the contemporary world require 
			competencies in dealing with the complexities of local contexts in which ordinary 
			people lead their lives. Taking globalization seriously, in other words, impels 
			us to cultivate a dual vision: while keeping an eye on macro-concerns, we need 
			to investigate multiple micro-contexts. Creating educational and research programs 
			that target the diversity of cultural practices in a highly strategic contact zone, 
			such as the Black Sea, is directly congruent with this agenda.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The initiative will develop open-access multi-media tools and reusable course 
			modules, pioneer the repurposing of available educational technologies, and integrate 
			curricular innovations implemented during the regular academic year with the summer 
			program in Istanbul, thus building toward a fully sustainable and dynamic program. 
			Through partnerships with NYU and Yale and through classroom sharing among consortium 
			institutions, we plan to create possibilities for shared curricular development 
			at other leading institutions, maximizing our impact on the field as a whole.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Finally, as a project focused on the study of networks, our initiative creates 
			new opportunities for expanding the existing educational and strategic networks of 
			Columbia University. Our planned activities will initiate research streams and new 
			lines of collaboration both on the New York campus and at the Global Centers in 
			Istanbul and Paris. By making the Istanbul Center the hub of our operative networks 
			in the larger Black Sea region, and by entrusting its leaders with the strategic 
			role of brokering our relationships with stakeholders and potential partners there, 
			we will help further its mission to emerge as a leading regional center with an 
			expanding sphere of influence and a truly global impact.</p>
