			<h2>Beyond Borders</h2>
			<p align='justify'>Traditional land-based area studies focus on divisions, on fixed 
			and heavily contested borders. In contrast, water-based studies emphasize patterns of 
			connectivity, mobility, and exchange, allowing us to bypass national boundaries and 
			subvert old imperial hierarchies. The Black Sea Networks project envisions an open sea 
			connected to waterways and land routes that lead east, to China; south, to the Mediterranean 
			and the Red Sea; west, to the heart of Central Europe; and north, to the Baltic Sea and beyond.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Rather than asking how Slavs are distinct from their neighbors, 
			the Black Sea model explores the shifting contexts they share with others. It aims 
			to reorient Slavic studies from a shared identity— imagined as homogenous despite 
			dramatic differences in the political and cultural history of the Eastern, Balkan, 
			and Central European Slavs—toward a shared space of ethnic, linguistic, religious 
			and cultural heterogeneity, where communities and individuals are bound by durable 
			links of conflict, cooperation, competition, and cohabitation. This new framework 
			will help foster a new generation of Slavists with a vision of the field that speaks 
			to the concerns of our global age.</p>

			<h2>Global Learning Strategies</h2>
			<p align='justify'>In order to promote long-term change in Slavic and Black Sea Studies, 
			the initiative will develop open-access multi-media tools and course modules and pioneer 
			the repurposing of available educational technologies, thus building toward a fully sustainable 
			and dynamic program. Partnerships with NYU and Yale and classroom sharing among consortium 
			institutions will allow cooperative curricular development at other institutions, maximizing 
			impact on the field as a whole.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The initiative expands the existing educational and strategic networks of 
			Columbia University, opening new lines of research and collaboration on the New York campus 
			and at the Global Centers in Istanbul and Paris. Columbia Global Centers | Turkey plays a key 
			role, engaging directly with the larger Black Sea region through existing networks while 
			serving as a hub for building new ones. This central position furthers the Istanbul Center’s 
			mission to emerge as a leading regional center with an expanding sphere of influence and a 
			truly global impact.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Bearing in mind the fast-moving and often unpredictable course of 
			events in the Black Sea region, the initiative emphasizes digital resources as a site 
			of collaboration. Even as political crises close borders, initiative partners will 
			continue to exchange ideas, work together on projects, and generate new materials.</p>

			<h2> RESEARCH STREAMS</h2> 


<h3>1. Iraida Barry and the “Russian Istanbul” of the 1920s</h3>

<p align='justify'>This is a long-term international project aimed at producing major art 
exhibitions at the <a href=" http://www.peramuseum.org/">Pera Museum</a> (Istanbul) and the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/wallach/">Wallach Art Gallery </a> (Columbia University, 
New York) that will showcase the art and life of Iraida Barry—one of the first female sculptors 
in the Turkish Republic and a key figure of the Russian émigré cultural presence in Istanbul in 
the aftermath of the Soviet Revolution. The exhibitions will aim to explore Barry’s fascinating 
artistic path in the context of major aesthetic and political shifts that occurred in her turbulent 
time. The exhibition will present for the first time archival materials from the <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml/units/bakhmeteff.html">Bakhmeteff Archive</a> 
(Columbia University) and the private archive of Cengiz Kahraman (Istanbul) together with Iraida 
Barry’s artwork from Dolmabahca Museum and private collections. Pera Museum also plans to host an 
international scholarly symposium on “Russian Istanbul,” in collaboration with Columbia Global 
Centers—Turkey, in conjunction with the exhibition.</p>

<p><h3>2. Black Sea Myths and Modern Europe</h3></p>
<p align='justify'>This is a long-term international project aimed at exploring ancient key Black 
Sea myths with a stable presence in the Western cultural imagination—Prometheus, Medea and the 
Argonauts, Iphigenia, Odysseus—and their life in the lands where these myths initially emerged. 
The project targets especially the little-studied political mobilization of these myths in the 
construction of modern national, regional, and pan-European identities for various communities 
around the Black Sea. Of special interest is the history of the political project “The Prometheans,” 
an alliance of representatives from various Black Sea states whose aim was to resist the regional 
hegemony of the Soviet Union between the two world wars.</p>
<p align='justify'>In October 2017, Columbia will host a <a
href="http://www.blackseanetworks.org/events">mini-symposium</a> dedicated to this project. A cluster of events 
in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv, part of the EU cultural program “Plovdiv 2019—European Capital of 
Culture,” will make available the results of this research to a large international audience. Apart 
from a scholarly symposium and a scholarly publication, we also plan international initiatives 
around the city of Plovdiv that will celebrate the legacy of Black Sea myths in modern Europe.</p>

<p><h3>3. Crimea: Meta/History of a Place</h3></p>
<p align='justify'>The main objective of this project is to combat “Crimnesia,” the tendency to ignore Crimea 
or relegate it to a marginal role in the history of many different countries and regions. We propose for discussion 
methodological questions raised by the study of Crimea, many of which also apply to Black Sea studies. How do we 
choose our historical timeframe and geographical boundaries? How do we work on a site in which traditional 
dichotomies of empire and nation-state do not apply? The peninsula offers a rich set of competing historical 
narratives; a metahistorical approach can help us to parse these narratives, isolate invented or politically 
manipulated elements, and interrogate our own preconceptions based on our areas of scholarly focus.</p>
<p align='justify'>This project emerged from <a
href="http://www.blackseanetworks.org/events">symposium</a> hosted by the
University of Cambridge in April 2017. We are planning a follow-up two-day
conference, “<a href="http://www.blackseanetworks.org/events">Crimea Matters</a>,” Columbia in April 2018, where we will workshop articles 
based on the papers presented at Cambridge and hear new papers from other colleagues representing additional 
fields and disciplines that reveal the true interdisciplinary potential of Crimea and Black Sea studies. 
The goal of this conference is to publish a special issue on Crimea in the journal <i><a
href="http://www.eliamep.gr/en/journal-of-see-and-black-sea-studies/">Southeast
European and Black Sea Studies</a></i>(Routledge).</p>

<p><h3>4. “Azbuka Arbuza”: Black Sea Languages Database</h3></p>
<p align='justify'>This project emerged from a research-a-thon we conducted in January 2017 that aimed
 to create a database that shows when the words for fruits and vegetables entered the various Black Sea
  languages. This data set will allow us to map the spread of these linguistic units against known Black 
  Sea trade routes, to see whether, as one might expect, fruit names were borrowed as the fruits themselves 
  were bought and sold. The resulting data set will be made available to other scholars to employ in their 
  own research, expand to adjacent regions, or re-imagine in other ways. Our visualizations will be presented 
  on the Black Sea Networks website and contribute to a publication in the forthcoming special issue of the 
  journal Russian Literature dedicated to Digital Humanities in Slavic Studies. The project has been co-sponsored 
  by the Center for Teaching and Learning and has been using the facilities of Columbia’s Group for Experimental 
  Methods in the Humanities.</p>
