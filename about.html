<p><a name='russtambul'><h2>Iraida Barry and the “Russian Istanbul” of the 1920s</h2></a>
<p align='justify'>This is a long-term international project aimed at producing major art exhibitions at the <a href=" http://www.peramuseum.org/">Pera Museum</a> (Istanbul) and the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/wallach/">Wallach Art Gallery </a> (Columbia University, New York) that will showcase the art and life of Iraida Barry—one of the first female sculptors in the Turkish Republic and a key figure of the Russian émigré cultural presence in Istanbul in the aftermath of the Soviet Revolution. The exhibitions will aim to explore Barry’s fascinating artistic path in the context of major aesthetic and political shifts that occurred in her turbulent time. The exhibition will present for the first time archival materials from the <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml/units/bakhmeteff.html">Bakhmeteff Archive</a> (Columbia University) and the private archive of Cengiz Kahraman (Istanbul) together with Iraida Barry’s artwork from Dolmabahca Museum and private collections. Pera Museum also plans to host an international scholarly symposium on “Russian Istanbul,” in collaboration with Columbia Global Centers—Turkey, in conjunction with the exhibition.</p>

<p><h2>Black Sea Myths and Modern Europe</h2>
<p align='justify'>This is a long-term international project aimed at exploring ancient key Black Sea myths with a stable presence in the Western cultural imagination—Prometheus, Medea and the Argonauts, Iphigenia, Odysseus—and their life in the lands where these myths initially emerged. The project targets especially the little-studied political mobilization of these myths in the construction of modern national, regional, and pan-European identities for various communities around the Black Sea. Of special interest is the history of the political project “The Prometheans,” an alliance of representatives from various Black Sea states whose aim was to resist the regional hegemony of the Soviet Union between the two world wars.</p>
<p align='justify'>In October 2017, Columbia will host a mini-symposium dedicated to this project (co-sponsored by the <a href="http://heymancenter.org/">Heyman Center</a> the <a href="http://harriman.columbia.edu/">Harriman Institute</a>, the <a href="http://classics.columbia.edu/">Department of Classics</a>, and the <a href="https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/center">Center for the Core Curriculum</a>. A cluster of events in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv, part of the EU cultural program “Plovdiv 2019—European Capital of Culture,” will make available the results of this research to a large international audience. Apart from a scholarly symposium, a scholarly publication, and international initiatives around the city of Plovdiv that will celebrate the legacy of Black Sea myths in modern Europe, we also plan several major performances at Plovdiv’s Roman amphitheater, including a premier of the dissident opera-oratoria “Prometheus Bound” (1969) by the Bulgarian composer Lazar Nikolov (1922-2003), dedicated to the victims of the Hungarian revolution of 1956, and a revival of the award-winning production “Medea, My Mother” (2012) by the Bulgarian director Margarita Mladenova, a politically charged meditation on modern Europe as Medea and the status of motherhood in the contemporary world.</p>

<p><h2>Crimea: Meta/history of a Place</h2>
<p align='justify'>The main objective of this project is to combat “Crimnesia,” the tendency to ignore Crimea or relegate it to a marginal role in the history of many different countries and regions. We propose for discussion methodological questions raised by the study of Crimea, many of which also apply to Black Sea studies. How do we choose our historical timeframe and geographical boundaries? How do we work on a site in which traditional dichotomies of empire and nation-state do not apply? The peninsula offers a rich set of competing historical narratives; a metahistorical approach can help us to parse these narratives, isolate invented or politically manipulated elements, and interrogate our own preconceptions based on our areas of scholarly focus. </p>
<p align='justify'>This project emerged from a symposium hosted by the University of Cambridge in April 2017. We are planning a follow-up two-day conference, “Crimea Matters,” to be hosted by Columbia in April 2018, where we will workshop articles based on the papers presented at Cambridge and hear new papers from other colleagues representing additional fields and disciplines that reveal the true interdisciplinary potential of Crimea and Black Sea studies. The goal of this conference is to publish a special issue on Crimea in the journal <a href=" http://www.eliamep.gr/en/journal-of-see-and-black-sea-studies/"><em>Southeast European and Black Sea Studies</em></a> (Routledge). The conference will be co-sponsored by the Ukrainian Study Fund and will be the forum for inaugurating The Annual Shevelov Lecture in Ukrainian and Black Sea Studies, named after the prominent Slavist and former Columbia Professor George Shevelov (1908-2002).</p>

<p><h2>“Azbuka Arbuza”: Black Sea Languages Database</h2>
<p align='justify'>This project emerged from a research-a-thon we conducted in January 2017 that aimed to create a database that shows when the words for fruits and vegetables entered the various Black Sea languages. This data set will allow us to map the spread of these linguistic units against known Black Sea trade routes, to see whether, as one might expect, fruit names were borrowed as the fruits themselves were bought and sold. The resulting data set will be made available to other scholars to employ in their own research, expand to adjacent regions, or re-imagine in other ways. Our visualizations will be presented on the Black Sea Networks website and contribute to a publication in the forthcoming special issue of the journal <em>Russian Literature</em> dedicated to Digital Humanities in Slavic Studies. The project has been co-sponsored by the Center for Teaching and Learning and has been using the facilities of Columbia’s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities. </p>
