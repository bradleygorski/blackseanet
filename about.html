			<h3>Beyond Borders</h3>
			<p align='justify'>Traditional land-based area studies focus on divisions, on fixed 
			and heavily contested borders. In contrast, water-based studies emphasize patterns of 
			connectivity, mobility, and exchange, allowing us to bypass national boundaries and 
			subvert old imperial hierarchies. The Black Sea Networks project envisions an open sea 
			connected to waterways and land routes that lead east, to China; south, to the Mediterranean 
			and the Red Sea; west, to the heart of Central Europe; and north, to the Baltic Sea and beyond.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Rather than asking how Slavs are distinct from their neighbors, 
			the Black Sea model explores the shifting contexts they share with others. It aims 
			to reorient Slavic studies from a shared identity— imagined as homogenous despite 
			dramatic differences in the political and cultural history of the Eastern, Balkan, 
			and Central European Slavs—toward a shared space of ethnic, linguistic, religious 
			and cultural heterogeneity, where communities and individuals are bound by durable 
			links of conflict, cooperation, competition, and cohabitation. This new framework 
			will help foster a new generation of Slavists with a vision of the field that speaks 
			to the concerns of our global age.</p>

			<h3>Global Learning Strategies</h3>
			<p align='justify'>In order to promote long-term change in Slavic and Black Sea Studies, 
			the initiative will develop open-access multi-media tools and course modules and pioneer 
			the repurposing of available educational technologies, thus building toward a fully sustainable 
			and dynamic program. Partnerships with NYU and Yale and classroom sharing among consortium 
			institutions will allow cooperative curricular development at other institutions, maximizing 
			impact on the field as a whole.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The initiative expands the existing educational and strategic networks of 
			Columbia University, opening new lines of research and collaboration on the New York campus 
			and at the Global Centers in Istanbul and Paris. Columbia Global Centers | Turkey plays a key 
			role, engaging directly with the larger Black Sea region through existing networks while 
			serving as a hub for building new ones. This central position furthers the Istanbul Center’s 
			mission to emerge as a leading regional center with an expanding sphere of influence and a 
			truly global impact.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Bearing in mind the fast-moving and often unpredictable course of 
			events in the Black Sea region, the initiative emphasizes digital resources as a site 
			of collaboration. Even as political crises close borders, initiative partners will 
			continue to exchange ideas, work together on projects, and generate new materials.</p>

			<h3>Key Activities</h3> 
			<p align='justify'>A <b><a href='/events.html'>yearlong Black Sea Event Series</a></b>, co-hosted by Columbia 
			and Yale, fostering creative exchange among the project’s team and advisory board, 
			scholars at Columbia across divisions, and outside experts, artists, and activists.</p>
			
			<p align='justify'>An <b>interdisciplinary symposium on Crimea</b> at Cambridge University on April 21, 2017, 
			co-sponsored by the Ukrainian Studies Endowment Fund.</p>
			
			<p align='justify'>A <b>two-day conference at Columbia</b> in September 2017, 
			generating a special issue of the journal <i>Southeast European and Black Sea 
			Studies</i>. </p>
			
			<p align='justify'>A <b>team-taught Global Core course, “Black Sea Cultural Capitals,”</b> 
			under the umbrella of the new Humanities project “Cities of Knowledge: Reading the Global 
			Metropolis.” The course will include seven modules: six focused on a single city (Istanbul, 
			Plovdiv, Belgrade, Constanţa, Odessa, and Tbilisi), and one on the Crimean peninsula. The 
			course will use technologies currently employed exclusively for language acquisition through 
			the Mellon-sponsored Columbia-Cornell-Yale shared course initiative, and create an open-access 
			digital library for Black Sea Studies that will support a future multi-media publication. </p>
			
			<p align='justify'>A summit at <b>Columbia Global Centers | Paris</b> that will present 
			initiative results to partners in the Black Sea region and to representatives of Global 
			Centers with potential stakes in the project (Istanbul, Paris, Amman, Beijing), and open 
			lines for further collaboration and broader adoption of the Black Sea model. </p>
