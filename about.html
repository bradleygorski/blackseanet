		<a name="borders"></a>
			<h2>Beyond Borders</h2>
			<p align='justify'>Traditional land-based area studies focus on divisions, on fixed 
			and heavily contested borders. In contrast, water-based studies emphasize patterns of 
			connectivity, mobility, and exchange, allowing us to bypass national boundaries and 
			subvert old imperial hierarchies. The Black Sea Networks project envisions an open sea 
			connected to waterways and land routes that lead east, to China; south, to the Mediterranean 
			and the Red Sea; west, to the heart of Central Europe; and north, to the Baltic Sea and beyond.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Rather than asking how Slavs are distinct from their neighbors, 
			the Black Sea model explores the shifting contexts they share with others. It aims 
			to reorient Slavic studies from a shared identity— imagined as homogenous despite 
			dramatic differences in the political and cultural history of the Eastern, Balkan, 
			and Central European Slavs—toward a shared space of ethnic, linguistic, religious 
			and cultural heterogeneity, where communities and individuals are bound by durable 
			links of conflict, cooperation, competition, and cohabitation. This new framework 
			will help foster a new generation of Slavists with a vision of the field that speaks 
			to the concerns of our global age.</p>

			<h2>Global Learning Strategies</h2>
			<p align='justify'>In order to promote long-term change in Slavic and Black Sea Studies, 
			the initiative will develop open-access multi-media tools and course modules and pioneer 
			the repurposing of available educational technologies, thus building toward a fully sustainable 
			and dynamic program. Partnerships with NYU and Yale and classroom sharing among consortium 
			institutions will allow cooperative curricular development at other institutions, maximizing 
			impact on the field as a whole.</p>
			<p align='justify'>The initiative expands the existing educational and strategic networks of 
			Columbia University, opening new lines of research and collaboration on the New York campus 
			and at the Global Centers in Istanbul and Paris. Columbia Global Centers | Turkey plays a key 
			role, engaging directly with the larger Black Sea region through existing networks while 
			serving as a hub for building new ones. This central position furthers the Istanbul Center’s 
			mission to emerge as a leading regional center with an expanding sphere of influence and a 
			truly global impact.</p>
			<p align='justify'>Bearing in mind the fast-moving and often unpredictable course of 
			events in the Black Sea region, the initiative emphasizes digital resources as a site 
			of collaboration. Even as political crises close borders, initiative partners will 
			continue to exchange ideas, work together on projects, and generate new materials.</p>

			<h2> RESEARCH STREAMS</h2> 


<h3>1. The Black Sea Exodus in the 1920s and the "Russian Istanbul"</h3>
			
<p align='justify'>This long-term international project explores the transnational cultural dissemination
that accompanied the refugee crisis after WWI and the Bolshevik Revolution.  The Black Sea Exodus
of the 1920s - a massive wave of refugees from Crimea and the Caucusus that washed up on the 
shores of Istanbul and then dispersed westward, mostly in the direction of Paris - has received
little scholarly attention and the "Russian" Istanbul, unlike the "Russian" Paris, Berlin, or New York
is still virtually unstudied.  Our research stream aims to put both of them decisively on the scholarly
map.  We envision most of our activities to culminate in 2020, producing interrelated events in New York,
Istanbul, and Paris.  We intend to capture the momentum of centennial commemorations of the Black Sea
Exodus, which we expect to generate new scholarly and artistic explorations of related events and their
effects in Russia, Turkey, and Eastern and Western Europe.</p>

<p align='justify'>Currently, this research stream is organized under two team projects, each pivoting
on a representative figure of the 1920s Black Sea Exodus.</p>
			
<p><h4>Project 1: Displacement and Display: The Ongoing Revolutions of Ilia Zdanevich</h4></p>

<p align='justify'>This project explores the work and legacy of <b>Ilia Zdanevich</b> (1894-1975), a Georgian-born
Russian avant-garde artist who, under the name Iliazd, spectacularly remade the phenomenon of <i>livre d'artiste</i>
in mid-century Paris and engaged in productive dialogue with major visual artists of his time, from Picasso and
Miró to Natalia Goncharova and Coco Chanel.</p>

<p align='justify'>Our international team brings together scholars and cultural agents (collectors, curators,
publishers, translators, designers, and performers) equally invested in exploring Iliazd's legacy as a
transnational artist par excellence.  We examine possible correspondences between Iliazd's movement across
political, linguistic, and cultural boundaries - from Tbilis and Petersburg to Istanbul and Paris - and his
tendency to manipulate conventions and straddle disciplines, probing the relationship between the condition
of a political refugee and the potential for creative "disciplinary" freedom.</p>

<p align='justify'>The project envisions a cluster of public events on the Morningside Campus of
Columbia University in New York during March 2019 and at the <a href="https://globalcenters.columbia.edu/paris">Global Centers - Paris</a> in June 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li align='justify'><b>An archival exhibition, "Ilia Zdanevich: The Tbilisi Years,"</b>	on view from March 7 until June 7, 2019
in the Chang Octagon Room of Columbia's <a href="https://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml.html">Rare Book and Manuscript Library</a>. The exhibition
will showcase new acquisitions by Columbia University Libraries prompted by our project and aimed to make Columbia
a major center for the study of Iliazd.</li>
<li align='justify'><b>A symposium, "Iliazd as a Transnational Artist,"</b> which will mark the official opening
of the archival exhibition between 4:00 and 7:00pm on March 7, 2019 in Butler 522/523.  It will include
public lectures by Johanna Drucker, Breslauer Professor of Information Studies, UCLA, a foremost specialist
on both Iliazd and the book arts in North America; François Mairé, President of the Iliazd-Club, Paris and
director of the Iliazd archive in Marseille; and Boris Fridman, private collector and curator of the exhibit
"Iliazd: the XXth Century of Ilia Zdanevich" at Moscow's Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts (2015-1026).</li>
<li align='justify'><b>A workshop, "Translation of Unknown Words: A Workshop on Avant-Garde Sound in Print,"</b> from 10:00am
to 6:00pm on March 8, 2019 in Butler 523.  The workshop will facilitate a conversation among specialists 
on Zdanevich and the Russian avant-garde, translators, poets, and editors on problems of translating
trans-rational (<i>zaum</i>) texts and related phenomena of the international avant-garde.  In the second
half of the workshop, translators will test their skills on selected passages from Zdanevich's <i>zaum</i>
dramas.</li>
<li align='justify'>An international two-day <b>conference, "Displacement and Display: Iliazd as a Transnational Artist,"</b> June
6-7, 2019 at <a href="https://globalcenters.columbia.edu/paris">Columbia Global Centers - Paris</a> and <a href="www.bnf.fr/fr/la_bnf/dpt_rlr/s.collections_reserve_livres_rares.html">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p align='justify'>Our goals are to generate an archival exhibition at Columbia Libraries that
showcases the results of its new acquisition campaign, to promote an English translation and
world premier of Zdanevich's <i>zaum</i> plays, and to produce a multi-media publication that
will benefit from <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu">Columbia University Press</a>'s new digital platform.</p>

<h3>1. Iraida Barry and the “Russian Istanbul” of the 1920s</h3>

<p align='justify'>This is a long-term international project aimed at producing a major art 
exhibition at the <a href=" http://www.peramuseum.org/">Pera Museum</a> (Istanbul) that will showcase the art and life of Iraida Barry—one of the first female sculptors 
in the Turkish Republic and a key figure of the Russian émigré cultural presence in Istanbul in 
the aftermath of the Soviet Revolution. The exhibitions will aim to explore Barry’s fascinating 
artistic path in the context of major aesthetic and political shifts that occurred in her turbulent 
time. The exhibition will present for the first time archival materials from the <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml/units/bakhmeteff.html">Bakhmeteff Archive</a> 
(Columbia University) and the private archive of Cengiz Kahraman (Istanbul) together with Iraida 
Barry’s artwork from Dolmabahca Museum and private collections. Pera Museum also plans to host an 
international scholarly symposium on “Russian Istanbul,” in collaboration with Columbia Global 
Centers—Turkey, in conjunction with the exhibition.</p>

<p><h3>2. Black Sea Myths and Modern Europe</h3></p>
<p align='justify'>This is a long-term international project aimed at exploring ancient key Black 
Sea myths with a stable presence in the Western cultural imagination—Prometheus, Medea and the 
Argonauts, Iphigenia, Odysseus—and their life in the lands where these myths initially emerged. 
The project targets especially the little-studied political mobilization of these myths in the 
construction of modern national, regional, and pan-European identities for various communities 
around the Black Sea. Of special interest is the history of the political project “The Prometheans,” 
an alliance of representatives from various Black Sea states whose aim was to resist the regional 
hegemony of the Soviet Union between the two world wars.</p>
<p align='justify'>In October 2017, Columbia will host a <a
href="http://www.blackseanetworks.org/events">mini-symposium</a> dedicated to this project. A cluster of events 
in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv, part of the EU cultural program “Plovdiv 2019—European Capital of 
Culture,” will make available the results of this research to a large international audience. Apart 
from a scholarly symposium and a scholarly publication, we also plan international initiatives 
around the city of Plovdiv that will celebrate the legacy of Black Sea myths in modern Europe.</p>

<p><h3>3. Crimea: Meta/History of a Place</h3></p>
<p align='justify'>The main objective of this project is to combat “Crimnesia,” the tendency to ignore Crimea 
or relegate it to a marginal role in the history of many different countries and regions. We propose for discussion 
methodological questions raised by the study of Crimea, many of which also apply to Black Sea studies. How do we 
choose our historical timeframe and geographical boundaries? How do we work on a site in which traditional 
dichotomies of empire and nation-state do not apply? The peninsula offers a rich set of competing historical 
narratives; a metahistorical approach can help us to parse these narratives, isolate invented or politically 
manipulated elements, and interrogate our own preconceptions based on our areas of scholarly focus.</p>
<p align='justify'>This project emerged from <a
href="http://www.blackseanetworks.org/events">symposium</a> hosted by the
University of Cambridge in April 2017. We are planning a follow-up two-day
conference, “<a href="http://www.blackseanetworks.org/events">Crimea Matters</a>,” Columbia in April 2018, where we will workshop articles 
based on the papers presented at Cambridge and hear new papers from other colleagues representing additional 
fields and disciplines that reveal the true interdisciplinary potential of Crimea and Black Sea studies. 
The goal of this conference is to publish a special issue on Crimea in the journal <i><a
href="http://www.eliamep.gr/en/journal-of-see-and-black-sea-studies/">Southeast
European and Black Sea Studies</a></i>(Routledge).</p>

<p><h3>4. “Azbuka Arbuza”: Black Sea Languages Database</h3></p>
<p align='justify'>This project emerged from a research-a-thon we conducted in January 2017 that aimed
 to create a database that shows when the words for fruits and vegetables entered the various Black Sea
  languages. This data set will allow us to map the spread of these linguistic units against known Black 
  Sea trade routes, to see whether, as one might expect, fruit names were borrowed as the fruits themselves 
  were bought and sold. The resulting data set will be made available to other scholars to employ in their 
  own research, expand to adjacent regions, or re-imagine in other ways. Our visualizations will be presented 
  on the Black Sea Networks website and contribute to a publication in the forthcoming special issue of the 
  journal Russian Literature dedicated to Digital Humanities in Slavic Studies. The project has been co-sponsored 
  by the Center for Teaching and Learning and has been using the facilities of Columbia’s Group for Experimental 
  Methods in the Humanities.</p>
